What happened to their fathers? My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts. Jon Snow. Your Grace. The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning. He wants me to lead one day.  If I\\'m a traitor, then you are, too. Hesitates. I want to be free. We stopped at Craster\\'s Keep on the way north. I saw... I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it. Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place? They stabbed me. Olly...he put a knife in my heart. I shouldn’t be here. Nothing. There was nothing at all. I did what I thought was right. And I got murdered for it. And now I’m back. Why? I don’t know how to do that. I thought I did, but...I failed. I’m not a god. I think so. Hold off on burning my body for now. If you have any last words, now is the time. Neither was killing me. I’m sure you would, Ser Alliser. You should. Wear it. Burn it. Whatever you want. You have Castle Black. My watch is ended. South. Get warm. I did everything I could. You know that. Aye, I pledged my life to the Night’s Watch. I gave my life. They killed me, Edd! My own brothers. You want me to stay here after that? With the peas and onions? We never should have left Winterfell. How could we know? We were children. You were occasionally awful. I’m sure I can’t have been great fun. Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played. There’s nothing to forgive. All right. All right, I forgive you. You’d think after thousands of years, the Night’s Watch would have learned how to make a good ale. Where will we go? If I don’t watch over you, Father’s ghost will come back and murder me. I can’t stay here, not after what happened. Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave? I don’t have an army. They didn’t come here to serve me. Sansa. I’m tired of fighting. It’s all I’ve done since I left home. I’ve killed brothers of the Night’s Watch. I’ve killed wildlings. I’ve killed men that I admire. I hanged a boy younger than Bran. I fought and I lost. I’m not Lord Commander anymore. \"To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon. His direwolf\\'s skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You -- It\\'s just more of the same. Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. We don’t know that. We can’t defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men. How do you know that? New dress? Thank you, Sansa. Don’t knock it down while I’m gone. That’s what’ll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you’re here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they’ll come for you. You’re right. This isn’t your fight. You shouldn’t have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn’t be asking you. It’s not the deal we made. I need you with me if we’re gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you’re going to survive. Lady Mormont. Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I’ve come with my sister to ask for House Mormont’s allegiance. Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost. Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect? 62? Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out. House Mormont. The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings. Lord Glover. We’re not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day.. We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can. Ser Davos is the reason I’m standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years. There’s no time. We fight with the army we have. You don’t have to be here. You’re right. There’s no need for a battle. Thousands of men don’t need to die. Only one of us. Let’s end this the old way. You against me. Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn’t fight for them? If he was smart, he’d stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out. It’s his weakness, too. His mean don’t want to fight for him. They’re forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning... We’re digging trenches all along our flanks. They won’t be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment. A pincer move. They won’t be able to hit us from the sides. No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt. Aye, for what they’re worth. You’re right. He’s overconfident. Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I’ve defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton. All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back? We can’t give up on our brother. Of course he does. What should I do differently? Aye, that’s good advice. Well, it is a bit obvious. When will we have a larger force?! We’ve pleaded with every house that’ll have us! The Blackfish can’t help us! We’re lucky to have this many men! Now, it’s not enough! It’s what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds. My lady. You weren’t at the war council. Any advice? If I do, if I fall, don’t bring me back. I’m ordering you not to bring me back. You’re in my camp. I’m the commander. How do you know what he commands? Why? What kind of god would do something like that? Get word -- We’re going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father. When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I’d sit down there. Aye, you’re right. I was luckier than most. What is that? Ride south today. If you return to the North, I’ll have you hanged as a murderer. I’m having the lord’s chamber prepared for you. I’m not a Stark. You’re the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We’re standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons. And you trust him? We need to trust each other. We can’t fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now. Well, Father always promised, didn’t he? The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield. The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won’t wait out the storm. He brings the storm. There’s nothing to forgive, my lord.', 'TYRION': ' I did hear something about that. And the other brother? There’s the pretty one. And there’s the clever one. I hear he hates that nickname. Clever girl. Have you? The gods gave me one blessing. Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother? She has odd cravings, our sister. I’m sorry, I’ve begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses. Close the door! Your uncle’s in the Night’s Watch. My greatest accomplishment. You – you’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you? Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though. And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you. All dwarves are bastards in their fathers’ eyes. If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle. The greatest in the land. My spear never misses. Beloved nephew. We looked for you on the battlefield. Joffrey sits down. You were nowhere to be found. What a fine job you\\'ve done. Turns to Myrcella. Look at you. Kisses her. More beautiful than ever. Turns to Tommen. And you! You, you\\'re going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. Tyrion smiles. He and Myrcella laugh. This one doesn\\'t like me. Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. Looks at Sansa. My Lady, I\\'m sorry for your loss. But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize. Of course you are. Well, Gulps down his wine, enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done. Don\\'t get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. Kisses Cersei on the cheek. War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on. Sits down It\\'s been a remarkable journey. I, grabs a glass, pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. Pours himself wine. I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for. Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings. Yes, but in his absence… If I were capable of tricking father, I\\'d be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. Cersei sits down. Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark\\'s head. Now the entire North has risen up against us. Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation. Who\\'s won every battle he\\'s fought. Do you understand we\\'re losing the war? Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us. Joffrey is King. I\\'m only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back. You love your children. It\\'s your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them. One? Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one\\'s head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child. A bit corpsey, yes. I thought you wanted to come here. You love the smell of dead bodies and shit? You can smell cum from the balcony? And so did the country. Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you\\'re here. You can\\'t trust anyone in King\\'s Landing. They\\'re all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars. Me? I\\'m not from here. I\\'m a slave to the truth. Why do you think I am so little? I\\'m being, Lays down on the bed with Shae, crushed beneath the weight of all that truth. Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn\\'t suffer enough. One of the many changes we\\'ll have to make around here. You brought this on yourself. Do you understand we’re losing the war? It was quite a battle. Begins to pour wine. Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie. Men like Lord Varys and I can\\'t let our disadvantages get the best of us. We\\'ll make a fisherman of him yet. Takes a sip. Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned. I don\\'t like threats. I\\'m not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played. And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea. You\\'ve perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father\\'s bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith. Safe travels, cousin. You have a deft hand with diplomacy. Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall. Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them. According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. The other stop leaving. Mormont doesn\\'t lie. Apparently you burn him. I don\\'t know what I believe, but here\\'s a fact for you. The Night\\'s Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall. Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine. Myself, I prefer the improper ones. You know your wines, my lord. Call me Tyrion, please. I\\'m sure you\\'re getting used to fine dinners, now that you\\'re a lord.Wars have been started for less. I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger\\'s brothel the other night. Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn\\'t realized peace depended on killing babies. Quite right. Especially the queen\\'s orders. No, but who else would want to murder King Robert\\'s bastards? She\\'s always been a jealous woman. You\\'ve heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister. That\\'s good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert\\'s bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei\\'s children. I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me. The fool! He had no idea you were already bought. I\\'m not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I\\'m denying its existence. Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you\\'d like to take it from my friend here. I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn\\'t feel safe with you lurking about. The queen regent. And you\\'re a fool to believe she\\'s your friend. No, we shan\\'t. There\\'s a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I\\'m afraid it\\'s rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way. His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch. To the new Commander. If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother\\'s breast, would you do it without question? I have every right. I am the King\\'s Hand. Listen to me, Queen Regent, you\\'re losing the people. Do you hear me? You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” Cersei says nothing. You don\\'t even have the decency to deny it. It wasn\\'t you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn\\'t even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse. I\\'m no king, but I think there\\'s more to ruling that that. Tries not to laugh. As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon. She was my mother too. Keep your voice down. I don\\'t intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens. Again, only temporary. But you wouldn\\'t be a cook. You\\'d pose as a scullion. Kitchen wench. Yes, but Your lion wants to see you alive. We\\'ve come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She\\'ll look for any weakness she can find. She can\\'t know about you. It\\'s a compliment, my lady. Language can be a bit tricky here. Oh! Thank the gods. I haven\\'t had a proper shit in six days. Right. I\\'m so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side. I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not? These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony. I\\'m trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn\\'t know. We can\\'t have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There\\'s too much at stake. I\\'m brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it. But remember, the Queen mustn\\'t know. I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy. Precisely. Theon\\'s father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father\\'s ships. But remember, you must tell no one. I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones. For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don\\'t you think? Who better? The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold and Harrenhal. Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You\\'ll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands. You served my family well in the matter of the succession. I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn\\'t need Janos Slynt. It\\'s settled, then? Good. Oh. And remember Myrcella\\'s a princess. Some would say she was born for this. Dorne is the safest place for her. That\\'s why we need to seduce them. We\\'re going to need their support in the war your son started. A guest. It\\'s done, Cersei.  You cannot stop it. Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They\\'ll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours. No, afraid not. Sorry about that. Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too. That\\'s a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a northern stockade. I would see him released. That\\'s where you come in. No, he won\\'t. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again? Find him? No, you don\\'t. You disappoint me, Grand Maester. So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne. See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you. Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats. Well, make do. How long have you been spying for my sister? I don\\'t like his beard. How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn? So you poisoned him? But you let him die, made sure he succumbed. Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells. For your trouble. Good. One of my better ideas. The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don\\'t mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave. Why, am I about to hear one? Depends on the sellsword. He has a sword, the power of life and death. I\\'ve decided I don\\'t like riddles. What is the meaning of this? What kind of knight beats a helpless girl? Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor? For what crimes? She did not fight her brother\\'s battle, you half-wit. The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him? I\\'m not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference? I apologize for my nephew\\'s behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement? Lady Stark, you may survive us yet. You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him? Your visits are too few, cousin.  So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep. If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she\\'d come herself. And you\\'ve received these instructions directly from Cersei? And you\\'ve waited this long to deliver the information? Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf. She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.  Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl. An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser? Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you\\'ve been bedding his mother? Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight? Did he tell you to fuck her, too? Hated every moment of it, is that what you\\'ll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister\\'s legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.  Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel. No, I think not. You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me. Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don\\'t have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it\\'s all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent. Oh, I\\'ll give her Pycelle. Yes, I\\'ll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length. Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way. Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour. It\\'s not what Varys says. He says Renly\\'s army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea. And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later. She\\'ll be safer in Dorne. It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don\\'t blame her at all for you. Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready. May I ask specifically what the king has in mind? It\\'s important that we talk about this. Wildfire? You wouldn\\'t lie to me, would you, cousin?That\\'s a lie right there. Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you\\'re fucking her, I mean. The smart money would be on more likely. But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours. I suppose there\\'s only one way to find out. When did she tell you this? Swear to me on what? But I don\\'t care about your life. All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out. Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me. Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have? Well, I\\'ve never actually been able to kill people with it. He hasn\\'t sent a raven in weeks. He\\'s very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won\\'t be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey\\'s planning on holding it. It\\'s hard to argue with his assessment. The king is a lost cause. It\\'s the rest of us I\\'m worried about now. You have to admire his imagination. What? Demon monkey? Blame me? I\\'m trying to save them. Demon monkey. I remember reading an old sailors\\' proverb, \"Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. \" My companion takes issue. How much do you have? My friend remains unconvinced. I\\'m afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King\\'s Landing low. You won\\'t be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You\\'ll be making it for me. Get the Prince back to the Keep now.  Move. Move! Where\\'s Sansa? You blind, bloody fool. We\\'ve had vicious kings and we\\'ve had idiot kings, but I don\\'t know if we\\'ve ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king. I can, I am. They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They\\'re starving, you fool. All because of a war you started. And now I\\'ve struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl? If she dies, you\\'ll never get your Uncle Jaime back. You owe him quite a bit, you know. Take some men and go and find the Stark girl. Are you hurt, my lady?  Well done, Clegane. Since when do you light your own candles? Stannis Baratheon\\'s fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, 200 ships. Yes, that\\'s more than we have. He\\'ll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind. \"Rain fire on them from above.\" You\\'re quoting Father, aren\\'t you? Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he\\'s not here. It\\'s just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead I thought the girls might help him. I was wrong. If we can\\'t control him It\\'s hard to put a leash on a dog once you\\'ve put a crown on its head. The boy is more Robert than Jaime. Sins? You\\'ve beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them. Yes, but do you have to do it here? You should start wearing the gold cloak. You\\'re commander of the City Watch. You shouldn\\'t be dressed like a common Well, you\\'re not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You\\'re supposed to stand out. Fine, fine. No gold cloak. What? What? What? Why are you staring at me? To help me plan the defense of King\\'s Landing. Stannis will be here any day. \"An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. \" By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh. I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery? For questioning? We talked about this. Stannis knows King\\'s Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it\\'s only 50 yards from the water. That\\'s where he\\'ll land. Pig shit. Thank you, Podrick. I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys. Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel. Younger boys are off fighting his war. What is he, 17? Remember Jaime at 17? It\\'s not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us. No, I\\'d say you possess above-average intelligence. He\\'ll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother\\'s skirts. Any dessert? Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it. Neither do you. It\\'s not that little. Why are you smiling? And why are you happy? I thought you preferred blondes. Why do you care who I fuck? This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me. Where did you find her? You\\'ve forgotten the most important thing about whores. You don\\'t buy them, you only rent them. And how do I know you haven\\'t killed her already? I\\'m sorry they hurt you. You must be brave. I promise I will free you. Never. I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you\\'re safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid. Shae! We have to be more careful. There are people who want to hurt me. I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I\\'ll have to before this is over. You\\'re mine. Promise me. To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way? A brave choice, Your Grace. I\\'m sure your men will line up behind you. Imagine Stannis\\' terror. You\\'re an intelligent man. I\\'d like to think I\\'m an intelligent man. I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men. What do you want? Tell me. My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of 19. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock. The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand  I do. Last thing I expected. I\\'d like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over.  The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine? We should sail there immediately. A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems. One game at a time, my friend. If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I\\'m afraid. I\\'m a Lannister. I don\\'t have a choice in all this. But it\\'s not your war. You can\\'t fuck your way out of everything. A wedding. \"Is that it?\" Nice touch. As if you don\\'t know the name of every boy in town. I\\'m entirely sure you\\'re entirely sure what I\\'m suggesting. Oddly enough, I do. There must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city.  I\\'m not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I\\'m the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her.  Well, I\\'m not. What of it? Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think? Mmm, don\\'t take it personally. I don\\'t entirely trust myself. No, I don\\'t believe you have. Remember, wait till the ships They must be far enough in I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood.  Nor you, my friend. Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn\\'t diminish our friendship. Oh! \"Enhances.\" Fancy word for a sellsword. Lady Sansa and Sheila. Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor\\'s holdfast. Always been a great romantic, my nephew. Will you? Stay safe, my lady. On the way. Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy. LANCEL: The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king- That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn\\'t have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won\\'t be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I\\'ve never much liked my head, but I don\\'t want to see it removed just yet. Archers to their marks. Hold fast. Hold fast. He\\'s a serious man, Stannis Baratheon. Rain fire on them. Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King\\'s Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now. Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too? You\\'re on the wrong side of the wall. You\\'re Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they\\'re going to take this city. Your king\\'s city. If you won\\'t defend your own city, why should they? Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them. I\\'ll lead the attack. I\\'ll lead the attack! Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king\\'s banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I\\'m half a man. But what does that make the lot of you? There\\'s another way out. I\\'m going to show you. We\\'ll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses. Don\\'t fight for your king and don\\'t fight for his kingdoms. Don\\'t fight for honor. Don\\'t fight for glory. Don\\'t fight for riches, because you won\\'t get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That\\'s your gate he\\'s ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape. Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let\\'s go kill them. Attack! Oh, fuck me. Pod. Pod! Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive. What happened? Where am I? Why should I believe you? To create strife between my sister and me. Pod. Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week? You\\'re a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times. Then my hill tribesmen. Don\\'t want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends. It was good of you to come. Believe me, you don\\'t. shakes his head Well? I\\'m a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double. That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me. Leave? What would we do in Pentos? I want to go with you. I can\\'t. I do belong here. These bad people are what I\\'m good at. Outtalking them, outthinking them. It\\'s what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I\\'ve ever done. Are you going to leave? Pod? What are they doing here? No, I don\\'t think so. They stay outside. Why are you here? The man who cut me lost more than his nose. Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn\\'t a rebel who tried to kill me. Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees. How do you know that? What do I want from him? He\\'s my father. Do I need to want something? I\\'m sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn\\'t come to visit once since arriving in King\\'s Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came. Why do you care what I want from him? Slandered? When? You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe. She lost an eye, if I remember correctly. It\\'s not slander if it\\'s true. Why are you so nervous about what I\\'m going to say to Father? Any lies in particular? Still makes me more clever than you. A number of people in this city want to kill me. You\\'re here to protect me. Do you grow bored protecting me? Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you\\'ve become a knight, you\\'ve served as Commander of the City Watch. I\\'m sure you filled your pockets. I thought we were friends. How much? Double? I don\\'t even know how much I\\'m paying you now.  sighs  The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position? I was very happy as Hand of the King. It wasn\\'t your bed at the time. Occasionally I drank with the harlots. Why does everyone assume I want something? Can\\'t I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield. I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start. I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir. It is mine by right. Why? We\\'ve spoken of this. You cannot come here. Did anyone see you? No. You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain. All right. What is this problem? Baelish doesn\\'t have friends. Oh, Ros? The redhead? I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you\\'ll need. Yes, well, we shouldn\\'t be judgmental about these things. Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice. But since I met you, my lady, I\\'ve been with no one else. Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she\\'d be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger? Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger? We can\\'t. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name. Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you.  I don\\'t even want to talk about her. Only because you\\'re making me. This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair. Hmm, yes. Only if you stop. But you mustn\\'t come here again. Do you hear me? You\\'ve come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people. Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it. Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish\\'s absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown\\'s finances unattended. Master of Coin? I\\'m quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn\\'t taught me much about managing it. A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers. Not for bastards. Pod. Pod. Take them outside. I\\'ll be there in a moment. Only my life. Not all that significant, I\\'m afraid. If only the Master of Coin had such power. Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding. We don\\'t. I did fuck her once.  But we don\\'t. Why don\\'t you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position? If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I\\'d be richer than you are. Good point. I\\'ve tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie. You think all reading is dull reading. The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages. Unless he made it all up, yes.  Podrick, do keep up.  Podrick. After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you\\'ve provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?  Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers. A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer\\'s face, wouldn\\'t you say? Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She\\'s here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me. Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.  She\\'s here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who\\'s never once failed to address me as \\'my lord. Be back in time for my supper. For years I\\'ve heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold. No. Worse, he\\'s borrowing it. We can\\'t afford to pay it back, that\\'s what\\'s wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father. Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you\\'re strangely naive. Well Ahem! The basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest. Well, you have to. This is why I don\\'t lend you money. Anyway, it\\'s not my father I\\'m worried about. It\\'s the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back. Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step? You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money\\'s worth. Or should I say my money\\'s worth? Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year. Oh, then it\\'s much more than I give you in a year. Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.  What did you do to them? And they seemed to like these things? Only they weren\\'t paid. Is that what you\\'re telling us?  {PODRICK doesn\\'t deny it. Sit down, Podrick. We\\'re going to need details. Copious details. I hope we might speak. In confidence. About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time? I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister\\'s intentions to-- I didn\\'t inherit Littlefinger\\'s spies along with his position, I\\'m afraid. Which is why I\\'m coming to you. I need proof. I need to know. I don\\'t know. Do I? Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-- The sorcerer. Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters. It\\'s the royal wedding. I\\'m told you had a hand in planning it. It\\'s shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used. I understand that. But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it\\'s a huge expense. And we\\'re at war, Lady Olenna. Yes, and maintaining supply lines-- And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm. I would. nods My lady-- Quite sufficient. Thank you. Give me that. What\\'s she doing here? You\\'ll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I\\'ve saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding. I\\'m Master of Coin. Saving money is important. to Cersei Stop that. You\\'re making me uncomfortable. Very well. She\\'s a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras\\' favorite bits, but I\\'m sure they\\'ll make do. It wasn\\'t my best, but-- Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother. The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it\\'s wise to refuse them? And how do we do that? Wonderful. You can\\'t mean it. Joffrey has made this poor girl\\'s life miserable since the day he took her father\\'s head. Now she\\'s finally free of him and you give her to me? That\\'s cruel even for you. She\\'s a child! And if I refuse? I was wed. Or don\\'t you remember? I don\\'t suppose there\\'s anything we can do about this. It\\'s hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery. On a boat you built. I\\'m your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family\\'s survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it. Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King\\'s Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater? The impulse I understand. He hates me because I\\'m the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy\\'s an idiot. I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger. Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister. You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels. Jaime or not, I\\'m truly fucked. I beg your pardon, my lady. Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa. Alone, if I may. Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it\\'s only afterwards when it\\'s too late that we realize we wished we\\'d heard it under entirely different circumstances. She\\'s a child. A tall child.  Not that young.  Older. Shae isn\\'t going to like it.  I should never have told you about that. Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them. I don\\'t pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don\\'t need company.  Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock. You could buy a ship with these. What? Of course you\\'re not going anywhere.  I didn\\'t ask for this marriage. I didn\\'t want it. That doesn\\'t mean that--this is duty, not desire.  I don\\'t have a choice. My father-- What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock. My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.  I swear to you it will not be like that.  I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for.  Listen. Listen to me, my lady. You are. You\\'ll always be my lady. Lady Sansa. Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark\\'s handmaiden?  My lady, I want you to know I didn\\'t ask for this. You\\'re right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel. But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won\\'t ever hurt you. Do you drink wine? Well, today you have to. Could you- Thank you. snorts  Of course. Of course. En--enjoy. Rather less than I plan to be. Isn\\'t it a man\\'s duty to be drunk at his own wedding? And? What did you once call me?  A drunken little lust-filled beast. There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit. There will be no bedding ceremony. There will be no bedding ceremony. Then you\\'ll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock. A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won\\'t even know I\\'m there. My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife. I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don\\'t you agree?  Come, I\\'ll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood.  Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion.  Nothing was ever wiser. Astoundingly long.  Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?  Well, talk won\\'t make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage. Stop. I can\\'t. I could, I won\\'t. If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won\\'t share your bed. Not until you want me to.  And so my watch begins. You really ought to knock.  Hmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. I have a list. For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-- My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they\\'ve been laughing at you. I\\'m the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp. The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We\\'re perfect for each other. Who? Whom? Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert. I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain. Lady Sansa! Why sheep shift? My lady-- Killed a few puppies today? \\'Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.\\' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something? No. She is no longer yours to torment. Oh, I\\'m a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies. You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper. A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king. No. I think armies give you power. Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same. Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn\\'t have certain assurances. I\\'m all for cheating. This is war. So that\\'s why you did it? To save lives? The northerners will never forget. Do you think she\\'ll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother? I will not rape her. Use small words. I\\'m not as bright as you. smirks No, it\\'s a very good lesson. Only it\\'s easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you\\'re making all the decisions. When have you ever done something that wasn\\'t in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family? Sansa. Keep up. It\\'s not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy. She doesn\\'t deserve this. There\\'s nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher. Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit? I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage. So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it? You have children. How happy would you say you are? Even Joffrey? How long does it go on? Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more. Please don\\'t. This is the Prince of Dorne we\\'re waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends. There\\'s bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years. No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat. Ah, here we are. Can you read the sigils? Boy knows his Dornish Houses.  And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear? Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King\\'s Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don\\'t see Prince Doran in your company. Nods. Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast. And where is Prince Oberyn? Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep. You must be weary after such a long journey.  We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies. You\\'re famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go? Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be... trouble. I\\'m here to welcome you to the capital. If there\\'s anything I can do to make your stay... Oh, I partook. Now I\\'m married. Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private? Oh, they take all kinds. The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding. Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult. Why did you come to King\\'s Landing, Prince Oberyn? I thought we were speaking truth. I wasn\\'t actually present. I\\'ve heard rumors. I wasn\\'t there. I don\\'t know what happened. My lady, you do need to eat. If I could have a moment alone with my wife. I can\\'t let you starve. I swore to protect you. My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you. I don\\'t know, but I can try. I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep. What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn\\'t know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn\\'t know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it\\'s true. Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear. What are you doing? How many times have I told you? You can\\'t visit me here. Of course I haven\\'t forgotten.  Things are a bit tense right now. My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister. I told you. It\\'s not a good time.  Shae.  Love her? I barely know her. She\\'s a child. She despises me. Of course I don\\'t love her. Ship you away?  What in the world are you talking about?  Shh. I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. Your new hand, it\\'s nicer than the old one. Wouldn\\'t you agree, Pod? You\\'re not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself. You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can\\'t get enough of it since one killed Robert for her. A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness. It\\'s only wine. What about your left? You\\'re the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword? Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand. You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one. Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king? Oh, to be foreign. So I\\'m guilty of being seen with my own wife\\'s handmaiden. My father will ask you if there\\'s anything more and you\\'ll tell him some clever lie.  Forgive me if I don\\'t weep for you. She won\\'t leave. I\\'ve told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it.  \"The Lives of Four Kings.\" Grand Maester Kaeth\\'s history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read. Don\\'t. Don\\'t call me that. I\\'m afraid our friendship can\\'t continue. There\\'s a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos. I\\'m a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don\\'t want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows.  I need to do right by her.  By our children.  I\\'m not afraid.  Shae. You\\'re a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can\\'t be in love with a whore. I can\\'t have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? 500? 5,000? I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over. You\\'ll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship. Better her than you. You saw her board the ship? You saw the ship sail away? How do you know? There\\'s someone following you? Hello. My lady. My lady. We\\'ll have to find another way to thank the king. One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night. A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled. Your Grace does me a great honor.  Let\\'s find out. I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace. If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired. Your Grace? Podrick. Apologies for the stench. A noble effort. You\\'re a good lad. Any word of Shae? I suppose that\\'s a good thing. What are they saying about me out there? Do you believe I murdered Joffrey? No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I\\'d plan it in such a way that I wouldn\\'t be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet? Of course. Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote. Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy. Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa. Gone? No one had more \\'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife\\'s disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick. They\\'ll be following you now. I don\\'t know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it\\'s my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I\\'m certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King\\'s Landing murders go. Varys could vouch for me if he dared. Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him. Why not? And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime? Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him? Are you going to accept their offer? Testifying against me wasn\\'t a suggestion. If they can\\'t tempt you with honey, they\\'ll choose something less sweet. Pod, the trial\\'s in a fortnight. They\\'ll want an answer before that. I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner\\'s block, I don\\'t want to see your head already mounted. Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King\\'s Landing before it\\'s too late. Pod! This is farewell. Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire. Is that supposed to make me feel better? It\\'s complicated, yes. So how is our sister? Her son? My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I\\'m guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she\\'s probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed. So, should I turn around and close my eyes? The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You\\'re really asking if I killed your son? Well, you could set me free. Then there\\'s really nothing else to say. Sorry, I\\'d forgotten. I\\'d hate for you to do something inappropriate. Except I didn\\'t do it. Sansa couldn\\'t have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it\\'s a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died? No, but... Sansa\\'s not a killer. Not yet, anyway. Let me guess, I\\'ve been pardoned. Really? Well, we mustn\\'t disappoint Father. No. Not that I know of. Choked on his pigeon pie. Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it. Oh, why don\\'t you tell them what Joffrey was doing? Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her. shakes his head Father, may I ask the witness one question? You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys? Not going well, is it? Oh, you think so? nods Shae. Please don\\'t. Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess. I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all. Yes, Father. I\\'m guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear? No, of that I\\'m innocent. I\\'m guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf. Oh, yes, I am. I\\'ve been on trial for that my entire life. To Cersei Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores. To the crowd I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it. I will not give my life for Joffrey\\'s murder. And I know I\\'ll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat. I\\'m sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit? Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I\\'m innocent and he\\'s willing to sacrifice me anyway. He\\'s willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You\\'re the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you\\'ll always be the golden son. At least I got to tell them what they really are. Don\\'t give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren\\'t there to save me. Where\\'s your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father\\'s face when you fall. Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword. Well... Bronn fought for me once, he\\'ll do it again. If he wins, I expect I\\'ll be in his debt for the rest of my life. Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it\\'s Ser Meryn Trant. I\\'d enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater. You have new clothes. I sent for you days ago. Doing what? Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn\\'t strike me as your sort of girl. She\\'s dim-witted. When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister? And you understand the rules of inheritance? She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies. scoffs. You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here? Is it two wives you want or two castles? I\\'m a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude. You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts. My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it. Does he frighten you so much? Because you\\'re my friend. I understand. Why are you sorry? Because you\\'re an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That\\'s what I liked about you in the first place. Yes, we did. I suppose I\\'ll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won\\'t that make for a great song? I imagined you\\'d be back at the brothel at this hour. Mm, do tell. I\\'ve got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like. Oh. Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts. She didn\\'t need to bother you. It looks as though I\\'ve taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She\\'s wanted this for a long time. I think I would have remembered that. You and my family have more in common than you might admit. That would have made things so much easier. Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants. If you want justice, you\\'ve come to the wrong place. Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man\\'s guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer? Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don\\'t get a name like that unless you\\'re deadly, right? Oh, he\\'s going to die. I\\'m going to die. That\\'s putting it mildly. What\\'s the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel? Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That\\'s the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There\\'s no kind of killing that doesn\\'t have its own word. Cousins, you\\'re right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister? Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock. Nothing made him happier. On the contrary. Laughing at another person\\'s misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else. For you. You drifted away. Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson. I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. \"Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?\" He gave me an answer. \"Smash the beetles. Smash \\'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!\" I wasn\\'t deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik\\'s library. Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn\\'t seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson\\'s affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn\\'t understand. But he wasn\\'t mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of \"khuu, khuu, khuu\". And when I wasn\\'t watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson\\'s beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard \"khuu, khuu, khuu\" and I still couldn\\'t figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason. I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once. He just pushed me aside with a \"khuu\" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about? Looks like very light armor. You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn\\'t drink before a fight. It could get you killed. It could get me killed. Thank the gods. Oh, get on with it you son of a whore. What’re you doing? Who’s helping you? Varys? I suppose this is goodbye, then. Jaime, thank you. For my life. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. All my life, you’ve wanted me dead. I loved her. Shae. I murdered her. With my own hands. It doesn’t matter? Say that word again. I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn’t poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why? I can’t go back there. She’s in there. I am your son. I have always been your son. I still don’t see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail. Do you know what it’s like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes? Pentos? Much better. I don’t think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don’t suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time. In a box. Why stop now? The future is shit. Just like the past. Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers. Not for a coward. You never told me why you set me free. You could have said no. Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You’re not family, you owe me nothing. A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms. You’re going to have to find another soldier. I’m done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me. I’m not well-suited for work. Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow. What is it you want exactly? Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that’s how they became powerful in the first place. I will never sit on the Iron Throne. Good luck finding him. Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen? There\\'s a bug. When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? finishes his cup of wine Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box? I want to take a walk. She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere. You\\'re right. No point. realizing The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What\\'s in Volantis? And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen? We\\'ve already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone\\'s banner hanging from it. I didn\\'t rule. I was a servant. Managed to kill a lot of people. She wanted me to leave King\\'s Landing. She begged me. I wouldn\\'t go. \\'Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant. takes a drink of wine I find us repulsive. You\\'re right. Let\\'s go for a walk. How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all? I have to get out of this wheelhouse. I have to get out of this wheelhouse. Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse. Walks over to him. I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can\\'t remember the last face I saw that wasn\\'t yours. I\\'m losing my mind. Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. Pulls his hood up. What am I? Varys shakes his head. One more drunk dwarf. Slaves. The only red priest we had in King\\'s Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one\\'s much better looking. Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You\\'d have better luck dancing away the plague. Varys shushes him worriedly. We\\'re going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn\\'t want to meet the Saviour? Covering his face. Come on. Let\\'s find a brothel. It\\'s even better luck to suck a dwarf\\'s cock. See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust. Curious... hair. She looks at him. It appears you\\'re not the only Targaryen supporter. Well, Watches her kiss the man, she\\'s taken. I need to speak to someone with hair. Hello? You\\'ve got no drink. Do I look like a man without money? She looks at him incredulously. Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. She laughs. But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? Sits down. I always pay my debts, I\\'m well known for it. That’s because they’ve never met a queen. You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you. Because you have a skeptical mind. After a moment. I\\'m, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t. I\\'m not. Gladly, but this, I can\\'t do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I’ll go for a piss, that’s a start. You made some kind of mistake. Why don\\'t you tell me what you think you are doing and - Thank you. After a long pause. Who are you? Do you have wine? I can\\'t sleep without wine. You\\'re going the wrong way. My sister\\'s in Westeros. Westeros is west! We\\'re heading east. You said you were taking me to the Queen. Chuckles. What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself! Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you\\'ve ever met my sister, you\\'d understand. So now that it\\'s clear we\\'re on the same side? Holds out his hands expectantly. Jorah makes no move to respond. A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You\\'re Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren\\'t you? It\\'s all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it\\'s all coming back. You passed notes to Varys\\'s little birds. She found out, didn\\'t she? Found out, and exiled you. Jorah looks downtrodden. And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I\\'d say the reverse is just as likely. Don\\'t worry. I\\'ll be fine. Nothing broken, I don\\'t think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. No response. Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let\\'s start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn\\'t have to be an unpleasant trip. We\\'re going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen. What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine. I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they\\'re not… I know where we are. You\\'re taking us through Valyria. Have you sailed this route before? You\\'re going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I\\'m not enough? You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren\\'t you afraid of the Doom? Oh. The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then - And then they weren\\'t. \"They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -\" I would clap. I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains. What was that? Mormont, cut me free! Jorah falls into the water. Mormont! Mormont! Mormont! Shakes his head. You? Jorah shakes his head. I\\'ve seen greyscale before, but nothing like that. It\\'d be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. Jorah spits. Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn\\'t have needed saving if you hadn\\'t kidnapped me in the first place. Jorah gets up. So what now? Without luck? That\\'s the best idea you\\'ve had all day. So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can’t live on berries and roots. You’re not hungry? You’re an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met. We are travelling together. In each other’s company. Therefore… I sailed from King’s Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word. Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis. I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn’t commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved. As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man. I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.” You didn’t know. I’m sorry. I am. I only know what I heard He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men. Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert’s Rebellion. I believe in many things. No. No. Doesn’t mean she’s going to be a great queen. The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity? We? Alright, let’s assume your dreams come true. She’s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what? So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That’s justice? Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king? Why is it anchored? Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let’s discuss this! Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can’t just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf? Guess again. The fighting puts in Mereen! You’re in luck then, you’re about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms. looks at Jorah Him. Sure, he’s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him! He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself. The Kingslayer! Wait! You have to buy me as well. We’re a team. I’m a great fighter, too. Thank you my Lord. Thank you. My Lord, if I may. I’ve heard Mereen’s become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage… What are you doing? I am the gift. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister. If only I were otherwise. You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time. Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It’s too soon to know if you deserve my service. When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least. Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you. Killing and politics aren’t always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name. I know. Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can’t remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you. Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals? And did he? A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you’re going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you’re ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do. Have you decided yet whether you’re going to have me killed? I can see why you would think so. It’s what your father would have done. My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I’d say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear. Some day if you decide not to execute me, I’ll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we’ll need more wine than this. So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers. I’ve heard stories. To see if you were the right kind of terrible. The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.  Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed. It’s not impossible that Varys was right about you after all. Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself. He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn’t have to do. I suspect he’s the main reason you weren’t slaughtered in your crib. Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother. That’s the one. Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting. No? Banish me? So if I’m not going to be murdered, and I’m not going to be banished... Advise you on what? The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else. I’m not entirely joking. There’s more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good. And when you get back to your home, who supports you? Let’s be generous and assume that’s going to happen. Here in Slaver’s Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won’t back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won’t back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough. It’s a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You’re not the first person to have dreamt it. The smaller man it is. There’s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time. It’s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor. My father would have liked you. Well said, you’re an eloquent man. Doesn’t mean you’re wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles. You can end this. You can! Stay close! Valyrian “Rusty” Common Tongue Thank you. He’s right. The dragon headed north. If we’re going to find her, that’s where we’re to go. And I intend to help her do it. You betrayed her! And she exiled you, twice, I believe? Don’t blame me for your crimes, Mormont. Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep. Pardon me? Not precisely, but I have other skills that’d be very useful-- I have fought. I don’t claim to be a great warrior. Middling. And drink. I’ve survived so far. I suppose there’s no point in asking how you found me. Well, she didn’t execute me, so that’s a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I’m stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade? If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies. I did miss you. We’re never going to fix what’s wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid. We’ll be fine. We’re dressed like common merchants. You’ve spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk? It’s a good thing you’re not a boy anymore...because you have no cock. I know what mhysa means. Hard to know. Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be. Very possibly. Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren’t even property to begin with. You can see why they’re unhappy. Of course, it could also be the freed men. Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them. It’s a problem. Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill. Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you. We can’t fight an enemy we don’t know. And have you started looking for that someone? Well, we won’t be sailing to Westeros anytime soon. If I lost my cock, I’d drink all the time. Meaning no offense. He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes. You think them. Surely there’s some good news lurking somewhere. Perhaps they can tell us their secret. What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid. Daenerys is the dragon queen. Can’t very well let the dragons starve, that’s obvious. Dragons do not do well in captivity. That’s what I do. I drink and I know things. The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles. Then Daenerys’s ancestors started chaining them up in pens. A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats. They must be unchained or they’ll waste away. Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons? And did they ever harm you? Dragons are intelligent. More intelligent than men according to some maesters. They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies. I am their friend. They will. It’s time they had their supper. When I was a child an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day. I begged him for one of you. “It wouldn’t even have to be a big dragon,” I told him. “It could be little, like me.” Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard. Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago. I cried myself to sleep that night. But here you are. Next time I have an idea like that, punch me in the face. What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about? You two, you spend a great deal of time together. What would you be talking about if I weren’t here? That’s good. That’s very good. But that’s a report. I was thinking more of a conversation. A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms. Me. Just now. All right, no conversations. Let’s play a game. You don’t play games, either one of you, ever? There, that’s a start. Oh no, no, no. Not that, of course not that. Innocent games, fun games, drinking games. Until you do. Oh, you took your time. You see? You don’t even have to worry about the local rebellion. We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it. If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen? You may be right. Possibly. It’s a conversation. Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis? I did. As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.” Yes, that’s the military approach. And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach. Long enough to know. And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.Here’s to reversals of fortune. Let’s make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want. Queen Daenerys won’t stay in Meereen forever. Her path takes her westward. Friends, friends, friends, please. There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing. That is the way of the world. I’m not here to change the way of the world. You don’t need slaves to make money. There haven’t been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you. But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it. So here is the queen’s proposal. Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver’s Bay time to adjust to the new order. Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice. Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices. In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy. Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same. I do hope you accept, my friends. You will not receive a better offer. Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it. And as a parting gift to our honored guests… Give freedom a chance. See if it doesn’t taste every bit as good as what came before. Excellent. I did. I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled. But I am not your ruler. I’m not the Breaker of Chains. I’m not the Unburnt. And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons. Because our queen chose me as her advisor. Until she returns from her travels -- Soon. You have my word. And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations. As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace. We offered terms. Those men respect you. As do I. I am not betraying her work. I am trying to save her city. For a short time. You’re right. Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once. War is a horror that should be ended at once. I can’t do both today. I don’t trust the Masters. I trust their self-interest. They’re trustworthy if they’re convinced that working with me is in their self-interest. They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast. Their contempt is their weakness. They’ll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage. It’s not enough. It’s not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that. Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced. Who said anything about “him”? That’s about the extent of my Valyrian. Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be. The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to -- Yes. She did indeed. Ideally we’d avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths. I’d settle for obeyed. That sounds most excellent -- We’d be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen. My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen. I’d call that a successful gambit. Look around. The city has come back to life. I did and it worked. Spoken like a man who has never had to shave. I’m going to miss you. I hope you’re right about this expedition of yours. Most of all, we need our queen. Varys. The most famous dwarf in the world. I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself. Now it’s like a man reborn. Why don’t you drink? Why don’t either of you ever drink? Why not? And who made these rules? Your former masters? Those miserable old shits didn’t want you to be human. Have a drink with me. That’s how you know it’s working. Here’s to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen. To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign. Do you like it? Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I’d like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp’s Delight. Only my close friends could drink it. Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath. Grey worm? ...but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.” It’s funnier in Westeros. Yes. A story that’s supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps. Missandei, do you like the wine? Tell a joke. You lied to us. I was wrong. I admit it. All right, what should the army do? And then? Despite appearances, I think you’ll find the city’s on the rise. Perhaps we should take shelter. Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you. Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters… ...it proves that no one needs a Master. Do we have a plan? You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King’s Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates? Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That’s why Jaime killed him. You’re talking about destroying cities. It’s not entirely different. I’d like to suggest an alternate approach. We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults. Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven. It always seems a bit abstract, doesn’t it, other people dying? Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen. It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can’t imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well. Doesn’t seem like it. He’s still alive. It was complicated for you, I’m sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don’t we? We can agree upon that at least. With the former Masters’ fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet. The Seven Kingdoms. What if everyone starts demanding their independence? How did he take it? I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That’s the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it’s any consolation. No, I suppose not. I’m terrible at consoling. All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you’ve ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It’s all yours for the taking. Are you afraid? Good. You’re in the great game now. And the great game’s terrifying. The only people who aren’t afraid of failure are madmen like your father. He wasn’t the first to love you and he won’t be the last. I believe in you. It’s embarrassing, really. I’d swear you my sword, but I don’t actually own a sword. It’s yours. Now and always. On a night like this, you came into the world. We won\\'t stay on Dragonstone for long. Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you\\'re not here to be queen of the ashes. We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south. Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who-- Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.  Doesn\\'t really roll off the tongue, does it?  Jon Snow?  Ned Stark\\'s bastard?  I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night\\'s Watch.  I can\\'t speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character.  If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally.  The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother.  Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.  If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.    I know how you wage war.  We don\\'t poison little girls here.  Myrcella was innocent.  But we won\\'t use Dothraki and Unsullied.  Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country.  If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point.  Our army should be Westerosi.  You are.  Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King\\'s Landing.  The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army.  Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.  The unsullied will have another objective.  For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros.  And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.  Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.  The bastard of Winterfell.  I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.  It\\'s been a long road.  But we\\'re both still here.  I\\'m Tyrion Lannister.  Ah, the Onion Knight.  We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.  Missandei is the queen\\'s most trusted advisor.  And Sansa, I hear she\\'s alive and well.  Does she miss me terribly?  A sham marriage and unconsummated.  Well, it was.  It wasn\\'t.  Anyway, she\\'s much smarter than she lets on.  Good.  At some point I want to hear how a Knight\\'s Watch recruit became King in the North.  A long and bloody tale.  To be honest, I was drunk for most of it.  Of course they do.  If I was your hand I would have advised against it.  General rule of thumb, Stark men don\\'t fare well when they travel south.  I\\'d say you get used to them, but you never really do.  Come.  Their mother is waiting for you.  Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.  Forever.  Almost.  I do.  I believe he\\'s calling all of us children.  Figure of speech.  The Army of the Dead?  No, I don\\'t think you\\'re either of those things.  The war against my sister has already begun.  You can\\'t expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --  If it doesn\\'t matter you might as well kneel.  Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys.  Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.  It takes no time to bend the knee.  Pledge your sword to her cause.  I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.  You\\'re making it difficult.  You look a lot better brooding than I do.  You make me feel like I\\'m failing at brooding over failing.  I wouldn\\'t say you\\'re a prisoner on this island.  You\\'re free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want.  I wouldn\\'t say we took your ship.  Why don\\'t you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I\\'ll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.  I do actually.  It was all nonsense.  Everybody knew it.  But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.  Good question.  People\\'s minds aren\\'t made for problems that large.  White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it\\'s almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister.  It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.  Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us.  And sometimes there\\'s more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye.  Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn\\'t.  Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now.  While you\\'re our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King\\'s daughter.  She protects people from monsters, just as you do.  That\\'s why she came here.  And she\\'s not about to head north to fight an enemy she\\'s never seen on a word of a man she doesn\\'t know after a single meeting.  That\\'s not a reasonable thing to ask.  So do you have anything reasonable to ask?  Maybe you are a northern fool.  I\\'m asking if there\\'s something I can do to help you.  Yes.  Volcanic glass, obsidian.  He says you have a tremendous amount of it here.  Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.  Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them.  I\\'m unsure of the nomenclature.  I\\'d very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it.  I don\\'t remember.  I would never do that...to you.  The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he\\'s here.  All of his advisors would have told him not to come.  I would have told him not to come, yet he\\'s here anyway.  You don\\'t have to believe him.  Let him mine the Dragonglass.  If he\\'s wrong it\\'s worthless.  You didn\\'t even know it was here.  It\\'s nothing to you.  Give him something by giving him nothing.  Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally.  Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand.  Casterly Rock.  You must allow them their flights of fancy.  It\\'s dreary in the north.  But you\\'ll have to go yourself.  Euron\\'s ships could be anywhere or in more than one place.  You\\'d be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.  It\\'s too great a risk.  You\\'re too important.  Yes.  Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister.  She will be ready.  No one has ever taken the rock.  The Lannister army is still the army my father built.  Well trained and well provisioned.  10,000 men at least.  They will see us coming.  They will be ready.  The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.  The fight up the walls will be hard.  We\\'ll be at a disadvantage.  Many men will die.  Interesting thing about my father.  He built our house up from near ruin.  He built our army.  He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn\\'t build the sewers.  That was beneath him.  So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find.  Me.  He was right.  I was low.  The company I kept low, women mostly.  They weren\\'t welcome at the Rock.  Father disapproved of that sort of behavior.  I couldn\\'t walk them through the front gates.  I couldn\\'t have them in my chambers.  So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself.  It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.  No better place for low pursuits.  Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress.  As a good friend of mine once said, \"give me 10 good men and I\\'ll impregnate the bitch.\"  And so it begins.  They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.  They will be outnumbered.  They will have less armor and fewer weapons.  But as my sister\\'s armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.  They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them.  They will be fighting for you.  And that is why they will triump.  We took Casterly Rock.  We still have the largest army.  Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.  We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.  Commit to the blockade of King\\'s Landing.  We have a plan.  It\\'s still the right plan.  If I\\'ve underestimated our enemies --  We\\'ve discussed this.  A smart one.  Flee, you idiot!  You fucking idiot.  My sister, she wasn\\'t your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time.  So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible.  Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace.  Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier.  He would be invaluable at the Wall.  You are the future of your house.  This war has already wiped one great house from the world.  Don\\'t let it happen again.  Bend the knee.  Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man\\'s head like a few weeks in a dark cell.  Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --  Your Grace --  All rulers demand that people bend the knee.  It\\'s why they\\'re rulers.  She gave Tarley a choice.  A man who had taken up arms against her.  What else could she do?  I am her hand, not her head.  I can\\'t make her decisions for her.  Daenerys is not her father.  Who is that for?  Did you read it?  What\\'s it say?  Perhaps not.  Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children.  What if we prove her wrong?  So bring the dead to her.  We don\\'t have to bring the whole army.  Only one soldier.  Bring one of these things down to King\\'s Landing and show her the truth.  The only person she listens to is Jaime.  He may listen to me.  Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.  You\\'re not staying here?  What if someone takes the boat?  I needed to see you and I knew you\\'d never agree to meet.  You made me look like a complete fool.  I thought I\\'d surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me.  You abandoned the family home.  Completely unsentimental.  Father would have been proud.  Listen to me --  It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.  He was going to execute me.  He knew I was innocent.  He didn\\'t hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am.  The little monster sent to punish him.  Do you think I wanted to be born this way?  Did he think I chose --  Daenerys will win this war.  You\\'re a military man.  You must know there is no way around it.  Daenerys is not her father.  She\\'s even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.  Fish hook.  Some men you just can\\'t teach.  He\\'ll do.  You may not believe it, but I\\'ve missed you Mormont.  Nobody glowers quite like you.  Not even Grey Worm.  This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us.  Remember?  Take it with you.  You\\'ll bring it back.  Our queen needs you.  I honestly don\\'t.  Oh.  I\\'ve been heroic on occasion.  I once charged through the mud gate of King\\'s Landing.  It\\'s interesting these heroes you name.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you.  Oh, my mistake.  I suppose he stares at you longingly because he\\'s hopeful for a successful military alliance. A million, give or take. There\\'s more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior. I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world. A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation. Supporting the enemy, no less. Cersei will anyway. Shakes his head. Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion. I don\\'t think I\\'m anyone\\'s lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. You\\'ve been thinking about our new queen. Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn\\'t exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk. It\\'s good to see you again. You might. And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through. She\\'ll be here soon. No. We are all facing a unique I think we ought to begin with larger concerns. Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn\\'t even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it. We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other\\'s hands. We have lost people we love at each other\\'s hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face. We all know that will never happen. There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you. I\\'m pleased you bent the knee to our queen That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we\\'re fucked. Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister. I don\\'t want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.  She\\'ll definitely murder you. I go see my sister. You spoke with her? I\\'m about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who\\'s already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who\\'s an idiot? A foreign whore you can\\'t abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you.  I didn\\'t know about that.  Cersei, I didn\\'t know. I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn\\'t want to debate and negotiate. She didn\\'t want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don\\'t want to destroy our family. I never have. After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn\\'t commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me.  I have never been more sorry about anything. starts All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me. If it weren\\'t for me, you\\'d have a motherIf it weren\\'t for me, you\\'d have a father. I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.  I don\\'t care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there\\'s anything left of it. If there\\'s no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come? Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something. Mm, not like this. Yes. Because I think she will make the world a better place. She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them. You\\'re pregnant. You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won’t freeze off. Because I have balls, and you don\\'t. If anyone survives the war to come, we\\'ll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause. I know, I know, our people haven\\'t been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die. My lord. My lady. The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it. Last time we spoke was at Joffrey\\'s wedding. Miserable affair. Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king\\'s murder. Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now. I\\'m sure you weren\\'t thrilled to hear the Lannister army\\'s marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you\\'ll be safe- She did. She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive. One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway. And our queen is grateful. I sense that you\\'re leading to a proposal. They do make a handsome couple. I\\'m not that old. Not as old as him. Our queen respects the wisdom of age. What is that? Your Grace, I know my brother- He came here alone, knowing full well how he\\'d be received. Why would he do that if he weren\\'t telling the truth? I was a fool. I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it\\'s all over. Well, here we are. Together again. And the masses rejoice. She\\'s your new queen too. They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They\\'ll come around once they see Daenerys is different. She is. I am. It\\'s hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents. Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her. Was she lying about the baby too? She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway. So we\\'re going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I would\\'ve chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and- My cock. At least Cersei won\\'t get to murder me. I\\'m sure I\\'ll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I\\'m being ripped apart by dead men. Maybe after I\\'m dead I\\'ll march down to King\\'s Landing and rip her apart. How will he find you? When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench. Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives. Do you need help? You\\'ve had a strange journey. I\\'d like to hear about it. If only we were trapped in a castle in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go. I wish Father were here. I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell. I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall. You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple. I was speaking in relative terms. Of course I miss it. It\\'s not. Things would be easier if it were. The perils of self-betterment. To contemplate your imminent death. You\\'ve come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It\\'s not bad. It\\'s not good either. And you? Ser Davos, join us. Would you like a drink? It\\'s strange, isn\\'t it? Almost everyone here\\'s fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together. I think we might live. I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards. Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke. Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne. Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms! No, let\\'s stay a bit longer. How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos? Ser Brienne? Mmm. And a Lord of Storm\\'s End who will be forever loyal to you.  I\\'m sure you had your reasons.   So did you?  I don\\'t imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before. Then you\\'re in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with. This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you. You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell. You\\'re the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark. You don\\'t want it. I envy you. drunkenly Your turn. Drink. Go again. Because it\\'s my game. Drink. Drink. Mm! No! You\\'re a virgin. At no point in the past, up until this very moment, have you slept with a man. Or a woman. The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King\\'s Landing. I watched the people of King\\'s Landing rebel against their king when they were hungry, and that was before winter began. Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside. Once the people see that Cersei is our only enemy, her reign is over. So if all are in agreement Jon and Ser Davos will ride down the Kingsroad with the Northern troops and the bulk of the remaining Dothraki and Unsullied. A smaller group of us will ride to White Harbor, and sail from there to Dragonstone with our queen and her dragons accompanying us from above. Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here, as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell. So she\\'s going to stay here with you? I\\'m happy. I\\'m happy that you\\'re happy. I\\'m happy that you\\'ll finally have to climb for it. Do you know how long I\\'ve waited to tell tall-person jokes? To climbing mountains. What\\'s she like down there? I haven\\'t been with a woman for years. Give me a morsel. I am the Imp, and I demand to know. You\\'re supposed to be south. That\\'s a bit rude. You\\'re a knight, thanks to me. I\\'m just trying-- See, I don\\'t believe you\\'d do that, after all-- You broke my nose! How do you know? May I speak? We made a deal long ago. Do you remember? Highgarden. You could be Lord of the Reach. It\\'s better than being dead. You have my word. None of this means a thing until we take King\\'s Landing. We ride south in the morning. We could use an officer with knowledge of the city\\'s defenses.  BRONN; chuckles  Oh, no. No, my fighting days are done. But I still got a few killing days left, you hear me? I\\'ll come find you when the war is done. Till then, don\\'t die.  My lady. \"My lord\" is the standard response. You know she loves your brother. You seem determined to dislike her. A good relationship between the Iron Throne and the North has been the core of every peaceful, prosperous reign we\\'ve ever known. I don\\'t expect him to spend much time here going forward. Sansa, look at me.  With Jon in the capital, you\\'ll be the true power in the North. I\\'d feel much better about the future if I left here today believing that you and Daenerys were allies. She\\'s your queen too. Every good ruler needs to inspire a bit of fear. No, but as your brother once told me, he\\'s not a Stark. Are you all right? Her people love her, you\\'ve seen that. You\\'ve seen how they fight for her. She wants to make the world a better place. I believe in her. Think of the past 20 years. The war, the murder, the misery. All of it because Robert Baratheon loved someone who didn\\'t love him back. Including us? Eight. She loses the North. She loses the Vale, Sansa will make sure of that. He doesn\\'t want the throne. He loves our queen. And she loves him. If we marry them, they could rule together. That never stopped a Targaryen before.  Something she has in common with every monarch who ever lived. We are advisors to the queen. Worrying about her state of mind is our job. We still have to take King\\'s Landing. Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all. That would solve our problems. It could be a fortnight before Jon and the allied armies make it to King\\'s Landing. In the meantime, demand Cersei surrender. Offer her her life in exchange for the throne. If there\\'s a chance to avoid the coming slaughter, we should make the effort. She\\'s a girl who walked into a fire with three stones and walked out with three dragons. How could she not believe in destiny? And how do you know she wasn\\'t? He doesn\\'t want the throne. That\\'s why he bent the knee. We\\'re discussing treason. Of course I\\'ve thought about it. Thoughts aren\\'t treason. Joffrey was a man. I don\\'t think a cock is a true qualification, as I\\'m sure you\\'d agree. What about my earlier proposal? They could rule together as king and queen. He could temper her worst impulses. How many kings and queens have you served? Five? Six? I\\'ve lost count.  At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in, and you fight for that person. I believe in our queen. She\\'ll make the right choice. With the help of her loyal advisors. What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don\\'t care who sits on the Iron Throne. So, what happens to her?  Please. Don\\'t. Queen Daenerys demands Cersei\\'s unconditional surrender and the immediate release of Missandei of Naath. Qyburn, you\\'re a rational man. We have a chance here, perhaps our last chance, to avoid carnage. Help me. I don\\'t want to see this city burn. I don\\'t want to hear the screams of children burning alive. Your queen. Her reign is over. You understand this. Help her understand it.  I know you don\\'t care about your people. Why should you? They hate you and you hate them. But you\\'re not a monster. I know this. I know this because I\\'ve seen it. You\\'ve always loved your children. More than yourself, more than Jaime more than anything. I beg you. If not for yourself, then for your child. Your reign is over, but that doesn\\'t mean your life has to end. It doesn\\'t mean your baby has to die. I\\'ll find you later. I\\'m going alone. I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city. Did you bring any wine? Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn\\'t keep prisoners for long. I suppose there\\'s a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys\\'s ashes can tell my ASHES: \"See, I told you.\" It just occurred to me. I\\'m talking to the only man alive who knows where I\\'m going. So is there life after death? I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.  I did. And I\\'d do it again, now that I\\'ve seen what I\\'ve seen. I chose my fate. The people of King\\'s Landing did not.  Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who\\'s done fighting? She liberated the people of Slaver\\'s Bay. She liberated the people of King\\'s Landing. And she\\'ll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all. Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen\\'s nature is fire and blood. My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won\\'t be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day. The moment the gates fell, the battle was over. And she burned down a city for it. Would you have done it? You\\'ve been up there, on a dragon\\'s back. You\\'ve had that power. Would you have burned the city down? scoffs Yes, you do. You won\\'t say because you don\\'t want to betray her but you know. It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I\\'m sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men. When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn\\'t you kill whoever stood between you and paradise? I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother. You just came up with that? Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you\\'ve always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you\\'ve tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now? It\\'s a terrible thing I\\'m asking. It\\'s also the right thing. Do you think I\\'m the last man she\\'ll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne? And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?  Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn\\'t want Dany to be queen.  No. But you do. And you have to choose now. It\\'s not for you to decide. nods You\\'re right. And no one\\'s any better for it. But it\\'s not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen. You\\'re the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one. Me? The Imp? Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her.  Can\\'t think of a worse choice. I\\'ve had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we\\'ve made. What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There\\'s nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he\\'d never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs, mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future? Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break. From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm. I know you don\\'t want it. I know you don\\'t care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day? To Brandon of House Stark I say aye. All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. I don\\'t deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn\\'t. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn\\'t. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else. Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night\\'s Watch. The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men. You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it\\'s a good compromise, I suppose. What we did. Ask me again in 10 years. I wouldn\\'t be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world. What\\'s this? I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism. Oh, he\\'s kind to me. Never would\\'ve guessed. He\\'s not kind? He what? What does he say about me? Your Grace. Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks. As you wish, Your Grace. clearing his throat We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign. That will improve. Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown\\'s debt to you has been paid? Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard? Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair. Find the best builders and set them to the task. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.', 'ARYA': ' Arya. That’s Jaime Lannister. The queen’s twin brother. Where’s the Imp? Stops walking. What do you want? Walks toward the cave. I have friends. You should have asked nicely. They don\\'t scare me. What are gold cloaks doing this far from King\\'s Landing? They\\'re looking for me. If you got within a mile of a battle, you\\'d fill your pants. Liar. So? Gendry walks over to get more water. Gendry\\'s an armorer\\'s apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle. What do the gold cloaks want with you? You\\'re a liar. Then I wouldn\\'t get to insult anyone. Follows him. No good\\'s ever come? Who asked questions before? Who asked questions? Lord Stark.

A girl will obey. He didn\\'t say. He just said, \"Walk through the gates.\" He didn\\'t say anything about the guards. We have to trust him. Shut up. Stay here if you\\'re afraid. What are you doing here? How did you know we\\'d come this way? How did you kill those guards? Was it hard? Where? My dancing master was from Braavos. I want to. But I can\\'t. I need to find my brother and mother. And my sister. I need to find her, too. What is it? Could it buy a horse? Then what good is it? Valar Morghulis. Please don\\'t go, Jaqen. Valar Morghulis. Would you please shut up about it? I\\'m not listening. Shut up. Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining? Where are we going? If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now. It\\'s 100 feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather he\\'s a lord. He\\'ll protect us. Shut up. Shh. Don\\'t. You go on down the road. Just keep on singing so we know where you are. Leave us be and I won\\'t kill you. What friends? Who are you? No, who do you fight for? I don\\'t drink ale. We\\'re not children. Gendry\\'s a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory. Gendry stole us weapons. He knows how to use a sword and so do I. My brothers taught me. You\\'ll free us? Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he\\'s our friend?  What am I? So I can walk away, then?  You remember the last time you were here?  What are you doing? We\\'re about to leave.  Hot PIE: I\\'m staying. Winterfell. I\\'m sure.  Hot PIE: Well, I made you something. What is it? That\\'s the tail? Good-bye, Hot Pie. Hey, Hot Pie. It\\'s really good. Can I take this hood off yet? What is it? Ugh! You murdered Mycah. The butchers boy. My friend. He was 12 years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer. That\\'s a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away. Kill him! No! ARYA: Let go of me! Let me go! Burn in hell! You can\\'t let him go. He\\'s a murderer. He\\'s guilty. You can\\'t! What are you doing? Why? Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they\\'ll spare the smiths? They\\'ll cave your head in with your own helmet. You don\\'t have to do this. Robb needs good men, too. We\\'re leaving tomorrow. And then you-- You just said you were serving Lord Beric. I can be your family. Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me? I\\'m a hostage and you\\'re selling me. But it is that way. More is than isn\\'t. So why don\\'t you? No. I thought he killed you. But how? Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once. I would. You\\'re alive. Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. What? But I have to aim. Never aim? There\\'s someone out there. I don\\'t like that woman. What does that have to do with anything? What are you doing? Let go of him. Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them! Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she? You\\'re not doing this for your god. You\\'re doing it for gold. You\\'re a witch. You\\'re going to hurt him. I don\\'t talk to traitors. But you did. You took the gold and you gave him up. He\\'s not my one true god.  Death. But what about Riverrun? It\\'s not south. It\\'s west of here. You swore. Why? So you can steal their gold? I don\\'t care what you swear because you\\'re a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. You\\'ll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all. There\\'s no one worse than you. You\\'re lying. Is that the Blackwater?  Back to King\\'s Landing to Joffrey and the queen. But why? Why would they be at the Twins? Don\\'t! Don\\'t kill him. You\\'re so dangerous, aren\\'t you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people.  A real hard man you are. You\\'re wrong.  I know a killer. A real killer. You\\'d be like a kitten to him.  He\\'d kill you with his little finger. No. Don\\'t kill him!  Please.  Please don\\'t.  No one’s going to believe you’re a hog farmer if you eat them all. I know they’re still there. I’m not afraid. I knew fear when I saw it in you.  You’re afraid of fire. When Beric’s sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl. And I know why, too.  I heard what your brother did to you.  Pressed your face to the fire like you’re a nice juicy mutton chop. Might do. Someday I’m gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull. Mind if I keep warm?  Frey Soldier #2: Fuck off. But I\\'m hungry. I\\'ve got money. It\\'s worth a lot. Sorry. From you. The first man. whispers Valar morghulis. When am I going to get a horse of my own? The little lady wants away from your stench. Why don\\'t you have any money? Didn\\'t you steal anything from Joffrey before you left? You\\'re not very smart, are you? You\\'re fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you? You think I\\'m gonna escape? Where would I go? I\\'d be dead by nightfall without you. My family\\'s gone. I\\'ve got no one. I\\'m hungry. You\\'re hungry. I know him. The small one. His name is Polliver. He captured us and took us to Harrenhal. He killed Lommy. He was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck. He\\'s still got it. My sword Needle. Lots of people name their swords. My brother gave me that sword.  He killed my friend. Something wrong with your leg, boy? Can you walk? I\\'ve got to carry you? Fine little blade. Maybe I\\'ll pick my teeth with it. Gonna rain soon. Where are we? You think? You don\\'t have a map? Maybe we should get one. How far is it to the Eyrie? And you\\'re sure we\\'re going the right way? On your way where? I\\'d like to see Braavos one day. I have friends there. We were just watering the horses. We\\'ll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it. He\\'s never been the same. The Tullys of Riverrun. Father! I\\'m so sorry. Really good. What did you do?! You told me you weren\\'t a thief. He took us in. He fed us and you... You don\\'t know that. You\\'re the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms. Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain. I can\\'t sleep until I say the names. Only the ones I\\'m going to kill. If he were here right now, what would you do? I\\'m almost done. Only one name left. The Hound. Practicing.  No one\\'s going to kill me. It\\'s not fighting. It\\'s water dancing. The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos. What do you know about anything? It was not.  Yes. He was killed. Meryn Trant. That\\'s why Ser Meryn...  He was outnumbered. Syrio didn\\'t have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick. Could be soldiers. You shouldn\\'t be sitting out here like this. So why go on? Nothing could be worse than this. Nothing isn\\'t better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing. My name is Arya. Arya Stark. You were Yoren\\'s prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he\\'d fuck me bloody with a stick. He can\\'t be. I don\\'t know his name. Thank you. You\\'re doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it\\'s gonna get infected and fester. I know you don\\'t like fire, but if you don\\'t do it right-- It\\'ll only take a second. It won\\'t hurt that much. Why? Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least. Lots of things make me happy. Killing Polliver, killing Rorge. At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over. You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him? That\\'s your stupid pride talking. It\\'s why you\\'ll never be a great killer. I\\'d have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to. You should have let me burn it. That fleabite\\'s got you walking a lot slower than you used to. You really think my aunt will pay for me? I\\'ve never even met her. I\\'m not a lady. People coming. You can shit later, there’s people coming! Morning. About ten more miles. Are you a knight? But you know how to use that sword. Does it have a name? Mine’s “Needle.” Who taught you how to fight? Mine never wanted to. Said fighting was for boys. My mother’s dead. You’re not a northerner. Why didn’t you? The Bloody Gate’s ten miles. I don’t care what you swore! I don’t need saving. You’re gonna die? I’ll last longer than you. I want to see the captain. I want to go north, to the wall. I can pay. I wouldn’t need a cabin. Please, I could work, scrubbing the floors, or… Where’s home? Wait, I have something else. It’s not silver, it’s iron. Valar morghulis. He\\'s just a statue. I\\'m not afraid. Thank you for bringing me. Valar dohaeris. Hello. Valar Morghulis. Jaqen H’ghar gave me this. Please. I crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go. But wait! Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant. Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant. ...The Mountain, Meryn Trant. Turn around and go. pulls out Needle Turn around and go. Nothing\\'s worth anything to dead men. Who are you? Why were they scared of you? You said there was no Jaqen H\\'ghar here. Well who are you then? I\\'ve been sweeping this floor for days. I didn\\'t come here to sweep floors. You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you\\'d teach me how to a Faceless Man. I want to serve. Jaqen stops. Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face. Where are they taking him? What do you want? What? After a moment, perks up. No one. Ow! Cunt! You\\'re about to find out. Stands up. I am ready. What do we do with them after we wash them? What are they doing with the bodies? No! I’ve been here for weeks. I’m not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I’m doing it. When? When do I get to play the game? The game. The game of faces. I didn’t even know I was playing. No one. Well who are you? What are you doing here? How’d you get here? What? Arya. Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. I’m the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle. After he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back. I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver. A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldn’t. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him. I hated him. I hated him! That’s not a lie! Yes. I’m not playing this stupid game anymore! Valar dohaeris. I know. Don’t be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me. I’ve devoted my life to him now. You don’t want to hurt anymore. Drink. My name is Lana. I’m an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more. Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade. How will she serve him? What will she do there? See what? Oysters, clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles! Best in the city. So why would a captain make the wager in the first place? If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money. The Many Faced God. You said you didn’t know what I would see at the docks. And then what? Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock-- Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Three coppers. The Thin Man wasn’t hungry today. Tomorrow. You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I’ve gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I’m glad he left me you. Do you know who I am? I can’t hear you. You know who I am. I’m Arya Stark. Do you know who you are? You’re no one. You’re nothing. No! No! No, you don’t die! Don’t die! sobs He was my friend. But if you’re… looks to the Jaqen who drank the potion and is seemingly dead Who’s this? I can’t see! What’s happening?! What’s happening?! Thank you. I can’t see. No one. No one. A girl has no name. A girl has no name. A girl has no name. No one. Arya Stark. Her father was Eddard Stark. Her mother was Catelyn Stark. She had one sister, Sansa, and four brothers. Three brothers. Arya Stark left him to die. He was on her list. He was not on her list anymore. She’d taken him off it. She did and she did not. Yes, she was. Which name would you like a girl to speak? A girl has no name. No one. Who was the first? Where did they go? A girl has no desires. Who? A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it. If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall… She’s a good actress. Seems like a decent woman. No. Who wants her dead? The younger actress. She’s jealous because Lady Crane is better. A girl has decided. Nothing. Three times. No. You’re very good. So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you. The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn’t just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her. Mercy. I have to go. My father’s waiting for me. Careful of that one. She wants you dead. You’re Westerosi. I want to book passage home. Why do you care? I want a cabin. And we’ll leave at dawn. See you at sunrise. You’re good at that. Where did you learn? And good at putting holes in them. What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead. Mmm. I can’t. I don’t think I could remember all of the lines. You wouldn’t be safe. Not while she’s looking for me. She doesn’t have a name. Essos is east and Westeros is west. But what’s west of Westeros? Nobody does. That’s where all the maps stop. I’d like to see that. What’s that? I don’t want any. Lady Crane? Lady Crane? You told her to kill me. A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I’m going home. My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you’re ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die. When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey. That\\'s a pretty song. I\\'ve never heard it before. I don\\'t want to steal your food. King\\'s Landing. Not so bad, is it? What are you doing in the Riverlands? Oh, no, I couldn\\'t. You don\\'t have enough. You\\'re a long way from home. I\\'m sure you\\'ve had some adventures, though. Boy or girl? Why? It\\'s really good. I\\'m going to kill the queen.  Hello, Hot Pie.  Sit down.  Who\\'s that for?  Mmm.  This is good.  I didn\\'t do that.  One or two.  Big lady?  She found me.  You got any ale?  King\\'s Landing.  I heard Cersei\\'s queen now.  Hmm.  Cersei would do that.  Why would I go there?  The Boltons have it.  What?  You\\'re lying.  Thanks for the pie.  Thanks.  Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.  Try not to get killed.  Nymeria?  Nymeria, it\\'s me, Arya.  I\\'m heading north, girl, back to Winterfell.  I\\'m finally going home.  Come with me.  Come with me.  That\\'s not you.  In there.  I live here.  I\\'m Arya Stark.  This is my home.  Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick.  They\\'ll tell you who I am.  Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North.  He\\'s my brother  If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?  Which Lady Stark?  Tell Sansa her sister is home.  I\\'m getting into this castle one way or another.  If I\\'m not who I say I am, I won\\'t last long.  But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away...  Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?  I didn\\'t run.  You need better guards.  It suits you, Lady Stark.  Jon left you in charge?  That doesn\\'t look like him.  It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.  We\\'re not.  They say you killed Joffrey.  Did you?  Me too.  I was angry when I heard someone else had done it.  However long my list got he was always first.  Of people I\\'m going to kill.  It\\'s a long story.  I imagine yours is too.  Mine neither, but our stories aren\\'t over yet.  You saw me?  So did I.  Most of them are dead already.  Where did you get this?  Littlefinger, he\\'s here?  Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?  Are you sure?  It\\'s Valyrian steel.  Don\\'t fight someone like her in the first place.  He didn\\'t beat the hound.  You did.  I want to train with you.  You swore to serve both of my mother\\'s daughters, didn\\'t you?  I won\\'t cut you.  Don\\'t worry.  No one.  He didn\\'t.  He trusted you to hold it for him.  These are mother and father\\'s chambers.  Nothing.  What?  You always liked nice things.  It made you feel better than everyone.  They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.  Their opinions are important to you?  Not if they lose their heads first.  And if Jon doesn\\'t come back, you\\'ll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want.  You\\'re thinking it right now.  You don\\'t want to be, but the thought just won\\'t go away.  My lady.  Father used to watch us from up here.  He wouldn\\'t say much.  You probably don\\'t remember.  You were inside knitting all the time.  One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick.  I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground.  Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw.  There was one arrow in the target.  There was no one around, just like now.  No one to stop me.  So I started shooting.  And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again.  I wasn\\'t very good.  Finally I hit the bullseye.  It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th.  I don\\'t remember.  But I hit the bullseye and I heard this.  I looked up and he\\'s standing right here smiling down at me.  I knew what I was doing was against the rules.  But he was smiling so I knew it wasn\\'t wrong.  The rules were wrong.  I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it.  Now he\\'s dead.  Killed by the Lannisters with your help.  That\\'s your pretty handwriting.  Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn\\'t write as well as you.  \"Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart.  Our good King Robert is dead.  Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --  \"Father has been charged with treason.  He conspired with Robert\\'s brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne.  The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort.  I beg you, come to King\\'s Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark.  Your faithful sister, Sansa.\"  Did they.  With a knife at your throat?  Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?  So was I.  I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.  And you were stupid enough to believe them.  I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block.  I remember the pretty dress you were wearing.  I remember the fancy way you did your hair.  I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor\\'s statue.  I wanted to.  I didn\\'t betray him.  I didn\\'t betray Robb.  I didn\\'t betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.  I was training.  Oh, I don\\'t know about that.  I can imagine quite a lot.  I guess we\\'ll never know.  I don\\'t know yet.  You\\'re scared, aren\\'t you?  What are you scared of?  You didn\\'t commit any crimes.  No one\\'s going to hang you.  Are you scared I\\'ll show it to Jon and he\\'ll be angry?  No.  That\\'s not Jon.  He\\'ll understand.  You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.  The northern lords will read it.  They wouldn\\'t think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei\\'s bidding.  What would little Lyanna Mormont say?  She\\'s younger than you were when you wrote this.  Are you going to say, \"But I was just a child\"?  Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things.  I\\'ll go with anger. Are you sure you want to do this? And what does honor demand? All right, then. Get on with it. My sister asked you a question. You told our mother Are you all right? You did the right thing. I\\'m just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You\\'re the Lady. I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived. I believe that\\'s the nicest thing you\\'ve ever said to me. \"In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another.\" I miss him. How did you survive a knife through the heart? Needle. Once or twice. Valyrian steel. Too heavy for me. She doesn\\'t like your queen, does she? She\\'s the smartest person I\\'ve ever met. I\\'m defending our family. So is she. Don\\'t forget that. First I robbed you. That was a nice ax you made for him. You\\'ve gotten better. Thanks. So do you. Stay close to that forge, then. Don\\'t call me that. Here\\'s my wish. Can you make it? Can you make it or not? You don\\'t know any other rich girls. You make my weapon yet? You should make mine first. And make sure it\\'s stronger than this. Are you going to be down in the crypt? But you\\'re a fighter. You\\'ve fought them? How many? What are they like? \"Really bad\"? Even a smith\\'s apprentice can do better than \"really bad.\" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill? I know Death. He\\'s got many faces. I look forward to seeing this one. My weapon? We\\'re not leaving you alone out there. Dragonfire will stop him? Guess I\\'ve changed. What are you doing up here? No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You\\'re here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself? For a little while. I\\'m not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits. That for me? This\\'ll work. What did the Red Woman want with you? Why your blood? Was that your first time? Your first time with a woman. Were you with other girls before that in King\\'s Landing? Or after? You don\\'t remember? One? Two? Twenty? Yes, you did. We\\'re probably going to die soon. I want to know what it\\'s like before that happens. I\\'m not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off. I am celebrating. Congratulations. You\\'ll be a wonderful lord, and any lady would be lucky to have you. But I\\'m not a lady. I never have been. That\\'s not me. We need a word. I respect that. We needed her. We needed her army, her dragons. You did the right thing. And we\\'re doing the right thing telling you we don\\'t trust your queen.  I\\'ll never know her. She\\'s not one of us. That\\'s all right. I don\\'t need many allies. We\\'re family. The four of us. The last of the Starks. You\\'re my brother. Not my half-brother or my bastard brother. My brother. What is it? I swear it. Me neither. Don\\'t like heroes. Felt better than dying. You\\'re heading to King\\'s Landing? Me too. Neither do I.  Probably. I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first. Try telling Sansa. Jon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You\\'ll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one. Say another word about killing my brother and I\\'ll cut your throat. I can\\'t. chuckles  I\\'m not going back north. What\\'s west of Westeros? No one knows. It\\'s where all the maps stop. That\\'s where I\\'m going. Right here.', 'CERSEI': ' What if Jon Arryn told someone? My husband. You should be the Hand of the king. We’ve been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait. Where is our brother? Go find the little beast. Yes. Lovely country. Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you? You’re tall. Still growing? And have you bled yet? And your dress. Did you make it? Such talent. You must make something for me. Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn’t stay hidden up here forever. Stop. STOP. He saw us. He saw us! You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt? And are you not a Lord at my command? Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? This is the small council. Our father is Hand of the King. Out! All of you out. The small council members all get up and leave until it is only Cersei and Tyrion. Cersei stands up and approaches Tyrion. I would like to know how you tricked father into this. I\\'ve done nothing. I tried to stop it. Robb Stark is a child. What do you know about warfare? Joffrey is King. You are here to advise him. How? One. Arya, little animal, she disappeared. Lord Baelish. I wonder if I might ask you for a favor. Ned Stark\\'s youngest daughter Arya... we can\\'t seem to locate her. And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her. If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts. A mockingbird. Points to a pin on Baelish’s shirt. You created your own Sigil, didn\\'t you? Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing. I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another. And which truth is that? Seize him. Cersei’s guards seize Baelish. Cut his throat. A guard holds a knife to Baelish’s neck. Stop. Wait. I\\'ve changed my mind. Let him go. The guards let Baelish go. Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. The guards do as Cersei says. To Baelish Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it. What is all this? We can\\'t find Arya Stark. Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They\\'ll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone. We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I\\'m sure if you asked grandfather - His life is in danger. Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne. Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip - What are you asking? What are you doing here? I’ve done nothing. What are you asking? “From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” Rips up the letter. He has more spirit than his father, I\\'ll give him that. You\\'ll give the Starks our reply, cousin? Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest? If you speak with him, tell him he\\'s not been forgotten. If that\\'s everything? Another king? How many is that now, Five? I\\'ve lost count. Perhaps he\\'s forgotten we\\'re fighting a war. We have no men to spare. One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. Walks away, followed by Varys. I have every confidence the brave men of the Night\\'s Watch will protect us all. Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him. You\\'re serving as the King\\'s Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent. Ha, the people. You think I care? He did what needed to be done. Now loudly. You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep. I don\\'t care what you think! You\\'ve never taken it seriously. You haven\\'t, Jaime hasn\\'t. Sits down. It\\'s all fallen on me. You\\'re funny. Laughs. You\\'ve always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death. Now they\\'re gone, for the sake of you. There\\'s no bigger joke in the world than that. Storms out. Soon, darling, when the war is over. The princess just spoke to you. He might. Would you like that? Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won\\'t you, little dove? I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon. Are you mad? The Martells loathe us. She\\'ll be a hostage. You won\\'t get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.  No.  No! Get out! Get out! Killed? By whom? Really? Who\\'d have thought? Whomever did it, I say well done. Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one. Aren\\'t there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away? Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety. So clever. Aren\\'t you always so clever with your schemes and your plots? No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations. You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same. It\\'s the king\\'s royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors. One day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it\\'s like to love someone, to truly love someone. Before I take her from you. Your mother might have prepared you. You flowered, my dear. No more. In what way? Wait until you birth a child. You\\'re a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means? A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen. Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood. Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag\\'s head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn\\'t allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion. You may never love the king, but you will love his children. That\\'s so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You\\'ll do things for them that you know you shouldn\\'t do. You\\'ll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice. You can try, little dove. Who did you say your mother was again? Since I decided that I can\\'t stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant. How many times can you read one raven scroll?  More than we have. We have strong, high walls. We\\'ll rain fire down on them from above. Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn\\'t he? I\\'m sure you\\'ll make a point eventually. I\\'m not the one giving the boy whores to abuse. Did you? Do you think I haven\\'t tried? He doesn\\'t listen to me. I always hoped he\\'d be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light. The Targaryens Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That\\'s what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It\\'s what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn\\'t they? What\\'s the saying? \"Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin.\" Odd little boy. You and Varys both. He\\'s only a boy. He\\'s not ready. Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don\\'t. His place is not on the battlefield. Do you think I\\'m an idiot? You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die. Do you know why Varys is so dangerous? Because he doesn\\'t have a cock. Perhaps I\\'m dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking. laughs Because I\\'m happy. Because I have your little whore. Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased. Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed. For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time. Varys isn\\'t the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully. Oh? Well, you\\'re the expert. Tell me. You\\'re usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don\\'t worry, she\\'ll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she\\'ll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn\\'t a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt. Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother\\'s whore. Get out. Your words are always wise and measured. You brought me something? I know what ten drops will bring. You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I\\'m sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon. Sansa. I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming? Fitting, isn\\'t it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine. So? I didn\\'t offer you water. What\\'s he doing here? Ser llyn? He\\'s here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him. Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they\\'ll be the first ones out of the doors. The battle\\'s first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning. The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen. He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine. Sansa, come here, little dove. You\\'re perfect, aren\\'t you? What are you praying for? Oh. On all of us? Even me? Even Joffrey? Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That\\'s why they\\'re gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn\\'t really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four. He believes in them, he just doesn\\'t like them very much. One for her. Here. Sit. Drink.  Not like that. Drink, girl. I should have been born a man. I\\'d rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.  It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey\\'s queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits. You\\'d like that, wouldn\\'t you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I\\'d have a better chance of seducing his horse. Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren\\'t a woman\\'s only weapon. The best one\\'s between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink. Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn\\'t, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You\\'ll be glad of your red flower then. When a man\\'s blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten. And you will be Joffrey\\'s. Enjoy. I don\\'t think I know this one. Pretty. That\\'s the worst curtsy I\\'ve ever seen. Here, it\\'s not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend. Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa\\'s service? When did you leave Lorath? I had a Lorathi handmaiden once. But she was a nobleman\\'s daughter. You\\'re not. When did you come to Westeros? From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in 10 years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that\\'s a very interesting story. What\\'s your name? Tell us a story, Shae. What news? Where is Joffrey? Bring him back inside at once. What? Bring him back to his chambers now. With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life? Now! When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he\\'s really here? He\\'s here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive. Where is my son? Why do I care what you want?  Bring me Shh! Be calm, my sweet. No one\\'s going to hurt you. I\\'ll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods. Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things. Like stags. And wolves. \"For one day, all the beasts will bow to you. \"You will be king. \"All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. \"The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, \"all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, \"they will all come to you, little lion, \"to rest a crown upon your head. \" And the cub said, \"Will I be strong and fierce like my father?\" \"Yes,\" said his mother. \"You will be strong and fierce just like your father. \" I will keep you safe, my love. I promise you. Father. cries Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside. Cersei: It\\'s your sister. The queen. Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in? If I wanted to kill you, do you think I\\'d let a wooden door stop me? I\\'m not afraid of you, little brother. I wanted to see your face. They said you\\'d lost your nose, but it\\'s not as gruesome as all that. I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey\\'s head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father. No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don\\'t suppose you need much room. You\\'re meeting Father today? Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him? You\\'re going to make me cry. Because you\\'ve slandered me to Father before. You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock. I was nine, too. If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again. And what\\'s this truth you plan on telling him today? Because you\\'re a liar. I expect you\\'ll tell lies about me, about Joffrey. You\\'re a clever man, but you\\'re not half as clever as you think you are. Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold. You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning. Cersei: An open heart is what you\\'ll get in Flea Bottom if you\\'re not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn\\'t stop them. The king barely escaped with his life. You\\'re right, of course. But you are your father\\'s son. We can\\'t all have a king\\'s bravery. I\\'m sure she does. That\\'s better. It makes you look very strong. Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric. Tell me what you think of her. Margaery. It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She\\'s beautiful and intelligent. Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting. I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself. Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason. You need to ask yourself chuckles I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge. The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats 700 comfortably There aren\\'t more than 700 people of any importance. Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn\\'t find all this a bit macabre? Yes. Seems like a lifetime ago. No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm\\'s End. A fairly predictable tragedy. Hunting and drinking don\\'t mix. I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm\\'s End for the better part of a year. chuckles And yet the world belongs to them. The gods have seen fit to make it so. Joffrey. Wait. Yes, about Jaime. I wanted to make sure we\\'re doing everything we can to get him back. You started a war. Whatever you can. Yes. The Tyrells are a problem. Margaery has her claws in Joffrey. She knows how to manipulate him. Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes. Lord Baelish. I wonder if I might ask you for a favor. I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown\\'s best interests at heart. My father\\'s a practical man. He appreciates facts. And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He\\'s almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don\\'t. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital. Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark? amused Yes, it is. She\\'s flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length. You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve. What do you mean? I will not. No, I won\\'t do it. I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare. Father, don\\'t make me do it again, please. We can have them both killed. Father doesn\\'t discriminate. We\\'re all being shipped off to hell together. The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family. I do admit it. If it weren\\'t for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate. What do you want me to say? Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won\\'t do anything now Father\\'s here. Not the Tyrells. Soon they won\\'t need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands. When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that\\'s going to be? He\\'s out there somewhere. Who\\'s going to tell her? Radiant? Why radiant? You\\'re a musical girl, aren\\'t you?  I imagine you have a lovely voice. Ah, but you know the song \\'The Rains of Castamere\\'? So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere? House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren\\'t the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?  Of course, ambitious climbers don\\'t want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you\\'d see further than all the rest. You\\'d be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now? Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword. I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. \\'And now the rains weep o\\'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.\\' If you ever call me sister again, I\\'ll have you strangled in your sleep. Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead. Stay. Nobody cares what your father once told you. A joke. Joffrey did not mean it. Let him make his threats. Hmm? He\\'s a bitter little man. Come along. We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest. Come. Leave. So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant\\'s best friend. Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you\\'ll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world. chuckles I won\\'t be marrying Ser Loras. You\\'re not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child. So she can have some happiness in her life. Not very. But if it weren\\'t for my children, I\\'d have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They\\'re the reason I\\'m alive. Until we\\'ve dealt with all our enemies. Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time. Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel? Elegant, I think. Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn.  I\\'ve grown rather fond of him. He\\'s quite talented, you know? Symptoms that are not your concern. You jealous? Laughs You think I\\'d let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat. Well, they smell like Pycelle. Yes. Let\\'s see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident. My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege. A rather short siege that I didn\\'t expect to survive. And now I\\'m marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I\\'m supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So... He can\\'t disown you. You\\'re all he\\'s got. You don\\'t really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you? Not now. Everything\\'s changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same? For leaving me. Don\\'t know what you wanted. You weren\\'t here. You left me alone. You took too long.  I\\'m saying you took too long. Come in. She\\'s the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one. He saw us. You\\'re an example to us all. Did you just bow? Lady Brienne. You\\'re Lord Selwyn Tarth\\'s daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not. I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King\\'s Landing. Did he? Haven\\'t heard that story before. I\\'m sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy. But you love him.  She\\'ll do no such thing. You should see Qyburn. He\\'s quite good. More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl\\'s thighs? My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me? But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here\\'s what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels. The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will. I suppose I am. Small pleasures. Can\\'t say I\\'ve ever met a Sand before. No? How tolerant of you. I suppose you\\'ll never know, Prince Oberyn. It\\'s a shame your older brother couldn\\'t attend the wedding.  Help him! Someone help him! Joffrey! Joffrey! Joffrey! Don\\'t touch him! Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him! My son. He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him! You did this. You did this! Take him! Take him! Where is his wife? Where\\'s Sansa? Where is she?! This is hardly the place or the time. It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. \"A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.\" That\\'s what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he... Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion. I don\\'t want a trial. He\\'ll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. CRYING Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy. Jaime, not here, please. Please. Stop it. Stop it. Stop. Stop it. Stop. Stop.  Stop. It\\'s not right. It\\'s not right. It\\'s not right. CRYING  Don\\'t. Don\\'t. Jaime, don\\'t. Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen\\'s door? So one? You have one man guarding the future king? The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?  I\\'ve been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free? She hoped or did you promise? So you made a sacred vow to the enemy. You didn\\'t mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark? I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.  And? You\\'ve always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He\\'d kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen\\'s door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander. There he is. Long may he reign. Yes. He wasn\\'t, though, was he? You still mourn for Joffrey? He would have been your nightmare. You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn\\'t matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I\\'m easily shocked? The things he did shocked me. He\\'s only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it. He will need help... if he\\'s going to rule well. A mother is not enough. You\\'re still interested in being queen, I take it? Yes, speak to your father. I\\'ll speak to mine. CHUCKLES As soon as decency permits. After we\\'ve allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband. That seems reasonable. shakes her head Shortly after Tommen\\'s. A fortnight. We had that in common. Then whom can we trust? Robert wasn\\'t particularly rich. Haven\\'t a clue. Pounds, tons, ounces? That can\\'t be. Then how do we pay for anything? How much? There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement. Someone does work there. It is comprised of people. It\\'s for the good of the family, I understand that. I\\'m not sure my brothers do. I respect that. We don\\'t need to discuss it. The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You\\'ve started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire? Prince Oberyn. Writing letters? May I show you the gardens? No, you couldn\\'t. I didn\\'t realize you were a poet. For your paramour? You have several, don\\'t you? Eight? Eight daughters? Beautiful name. Perhaps that\\'s why she\\'s difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don\\'t they? You\\'re a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I\\'m a Lannister. Queen for 19 years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love? Yes, we can avenge them. I know he did. We\\'ll have a trial, anyway. I haven\\'t seen my daughter in over a year. I want to believe that. I want to believe she\\'s happy. Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn\\'t there for her name day. I don\\'t know when I\\'ll see her again. The best shipwrights in King\\'s Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water. Please tell her... her mother misses her very much. A coward and a traitor. Conquered with what? Baby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace. He\\'s an old man. He wasn\\'t fit to protect my son. Don\\'t tell me you\\'re worried about a child halfway across the world. \"I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid.\" Nods. Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops. I discovered he\\'d been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn\\'t pleased. Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly. You seem to be in good form. Does it matter? Bloody Martells. You\\'re dismissed, Grand Maester. Not anymore. You can save him? Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need. Will it weaken him? Very well then. I\\'m opening it again. I will not. I don\\'t care. I will stay in King\\'s Landing where I belong with my son, the king. I\\'m not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn\\'t going to be one of those times. When you marched into the throne room to tell me we\\'d won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that\\'s how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away. Joffrey is dead. Myrcella\\'s been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen. I\\'ll tell everyone the truth. You don\\'t know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it\\'s possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn\\'t see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you would\\'ve known. Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me. Your legacy is a lie. Yes you do. Jaime. For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn\\'t imagine. He\\'s not. I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world- A disease doesn\\'t decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose? I choose you. Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him. I told him about us. I told him I wouldn\\'t marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I\\'m staying right here with Tommen, with you. Go and ask him. I don\\'t want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don\\'t choose Tywin Lannister, I don\\'t love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they\\'ll make their jokes. Let them. They\\'re all so small I can\\'t even see them. I only see what matters. I don\\'t care. Why not? He’ll never know we’ve been gone. You don’t need to be afraid of my father. Yes. Of course we should. No. They said that you were terrifying. With cat’s teeth and three eyes. You’re not terrifying. You’re boring. I know you’re a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine. This is my father’s land. My land. Tell me my future or I’ll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head. I’ve been promised to the prince. When will we marry? But I will be queen? Will the king and I have children? That doesn’t make sense. They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him. They will wait. He never wanted you to be a King’s Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body. They? They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he’s the enemy. I’ve been telling you for years, you’ve been defending him for years… ...and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free? Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You’re a man of action, aren’t you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. gestures towards Tywin Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world. Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you. Uncle, it’s quite alright. I’m sure he’ll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me. Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed. What can I do for you? What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness? I doubt you’ve ever led anyone anywhere. I don’t know what you’re talking about. The day Tywin Lannister’s soul needs your help… There are only two like it in the world: the one I’m wearing and the one I gave to Myrcella. Of course it’s a threat! Our daughter’s in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. mocking \"It\\'s a threat.\" They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that’s befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her! What? Our daughter’s in danger, and you’re worried I’m speaking too loudly! Then don’t call her your daughter. You’ve never been a father to her. And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden. You never made anything better. You can’t just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She’s promised his son. You go there with an army, it’s an act of war. Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens. scoffs You’re going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone? Not him. That won\\'t be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don\\'t want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made. Take the head. Very good. No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I\\'m merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself. You\\'re a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don\\'t imagine you\\'ll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin. He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown\\'s interests in the same. The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers. The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That\\'s far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have. The king is very busy at this moment. He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he\\'s asked me to speak on his behalf. My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission. That is not your concern as Master of War. You would abandon your king in his time of need? You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She\\'s certainly very pretty, isn\\'t she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she\\'s intelligent? I can\\'t quite tell. Not that it matters. There\\'s nothing for me in Casterly Rock. Chuckles. Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock? This is my real home now. Where my family lives. I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy. Don\\'t you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you. No, no. I, I can\\'t stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you. Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen. Good. Good. I\\'m glad to hear you\\'re happy. I\\'ll leave you to it then. Turns to leave. There\\'s no need for such formalities. Won’t that be a lovely day. Remember. Anything you need. You were assaulted? What do you want from us, High Septon? And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow? Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. To a man at the bottom of some stairs. Where can I find the High Sparrow? A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he? Why no shoes? Is that why you came to King\\'s Landing? To remind everyone? Smiles. Perhaps they\\'re right. An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn\\'t you say? The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn\\'t want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you. After a moment. My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon\\'s behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep\\'s dungeons instead. The High Sparrow looks up at her surprised. The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another. Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he\\'s slithering about. Hands him the letter. How\\'s your work coming along? You\\'ve made progress? Very good. I\\'ll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word \"immediately\". How much can the Crown afford? You\\'re the Master of Coin. How do we pay them? You\\'ve already given us too much. Gets up and walks to a window. No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank. In person. We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King\\'s Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified. The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law\\'s safety on this voyage. Smiling. He\\'s ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort. Safe travels, Lord Tyrell. Walking out. Not small enough. May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness? The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. Smiles. Hmm. All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets. Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. HS raises an eyebrow. In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven. If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy. An army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven. Which is why you were chosen. HS smiles. You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most. Smiles. Continues after a moment. What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege. Turns around. Did I arrest him? I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. Begins walking towards her desk. Can\\'t allow fanatics to arrest the Queen\\'s brother, no matter his perversions. I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You\\'re the King. I\\'m sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he\\'ll release the poor boy. The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden. The King’s orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras’ perversion? House Tyrell won’t tolerate it? I’m the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys. Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you’re still in mourning. She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him. If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king? Good. Cersei gets up If there’s nothing else. That’s not possible. Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father. We were fools to trust a turncloak. I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil. Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor. Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn. My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse. Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I’ve no idea when he’ll be back. Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man. And if you succeed? I’ll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree. And I’ll l know you’re a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark’s head on a spike. You must be exhausted. Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns. Beg your pardon. If you apologize for that comment perhaps-- I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do? I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains-- As I said, i didn’t imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats-- The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare? House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I’m sure they don’t. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we’ll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna. This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden? Starving yourself won\\'t make things any better for her, my love. No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you\\'ll face circumstances beyond your control. You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be. We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair. Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic. Your happiness is all I want in this world No you don’t. You can’t possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy. This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It’s quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind. We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods. You’re upset. You’re not thinking clearly. I’ll visit again when you’ve had a chance to calm down. I do hope you change your mind about that. I’ve been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins. Yes, I’m afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever. Sleep well, sister. Yes. Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now? Who will stand judge? Will you be one of them? If one or both of them were to confess before the trial… What does The Mother’s mercy entail? Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven. I think I may have heard at one point. I’m afraid i don’t. Move. Let me go immediately. Look at me. Look at my face. It’s the last thing you’ll see before you die. My son. Let me speak to-- My face will be the last thing you see before-- The charges? All lies. I wish you’d said it sooner. Any word from Jaime? Tell him I need to speak to him. What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king-- You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother. I can’t stay here. Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won’t. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness. I’ll get out of here, you realize. Before long. I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court. I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die. I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light-- Once I’ve confessed, will I be free? The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess. Lancel Lannister. I was lonely and afraid. A husband of whoring every chance he got. May the gods forgive me. No. No. I do. A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother’s children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers’. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it. Trial? I have confessed? I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother’s mercy. I haven’t seen my son… I don’t know how long it’s been. I need to see him. Please. Thank you. Thank you. I will, I will. I swear it, day and night. Am I free to go? My atonement? Myrcella… Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body? All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now. Every day, every night, what does Mama look like now? Has she started to bloat? Has her skin turned black? Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?  I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt. I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse. I have to. I have to. It’s not right she has to suffer alone. I thought if I could make something so good, so pure...maybe I’m not a monster. No, I knew this would happen. The witch told me years ago. She promised me three children. She promised me they’d die. “And gold their shrouds.” Everything she said came true. You couldn’t have stopped it. It’s prophecy. It’s fate. Of course I do. You told me yourself when Father died. You said we had to stay together. You said people would try to tear us apart, take what’s ours. That was a prophecy, too. I didn’t listen to you, and everything you said came true. Get out of my way. What are the king’s orders? You’re barring me from attending my own daughter’s funeral? I would like to speak to my son. Did they put her in the red gown or the gold? Good. It was always her color. I understand. I’m glad to see you. It’s all right. Always. Varys\\'s little birds? The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him. Ser Gregor will can’t face them all. And he won’t have to. He’ll only have to face one. Not yet. Thank you for bringing it up. It’s well past time we addressed the abuses I endured. Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement? And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it. What are you doing here? Is this a Small Council meeting? Since I’ve missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things. As have we all, unfortunately. Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king’s own mother? It’s all right. It\\'s done. It’s in the past. And of course Margaery’s safety is paramount. Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone’s. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing. You’ve spoken with him? It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me. The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king’s orders. You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one’s rivals. The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we\\'d bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he’ll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city. You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they’ve done to your son.  Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good? Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed. BEtter you’re elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons. What, then? You can’t. We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won’t leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it’s ours and because you can. It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They’ve made us both stronger, all of them. They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we’re going to do to them. We’ve always been together. We’ll always be together. We’re the only two people in the world. I heard you were leaving King’s Landing. Your grandson is still a prisoner. You’ll leave him rotting in a cell? You’re right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day. I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other. You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It’s the only truth I know. We must defend them. Never. I’ll never leave my son. Have been permitted? That’s rather a tortured way of putting it. Who permitted them inside the Red Keep? The king is aware of their presence? His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep. It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I’m refusing. He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial. Get out. I choose violence. Please tell His High Holiness he’s always welcome to visit. There’s to be a royal announcement? Why wasn’t I informed? To stand by my son. And? Was it just a rumor or something more? Confess. Confess. Confess. Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn’t do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances. You’ve always been quiet. I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember? What? Now? Today? You’re not going to die today. You’re not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor. This is Ser Gregor Clegane. He’s quiet, too. Your gods have forsaken you. This is your god now. Shame. Shame. Shame. Show me. Show me. He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood. Its what we\\'ve been waiting for our whole lives. It\\'s what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not. It\\'s ours now, we just have to take it. You\\'ve been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me? Are you afraid of me? Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they\\'re sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father\\'s throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He\\'s out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land? Enemies to the east. Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches. Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor. Enemies to the north. Ned Stark\\'s bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We\\'re surrounded by traitors. You\\'re in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed? Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers? I\\'m the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I understand we\\'re in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years. A dynasty for us, then. There\\'s nothing to say. He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children? I loved them. I did. But they\\'re ashes now and we\\'re still flesh and blood. We\\'re the last Lannisters, the last ones who count. I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that? You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing? Not all of them. I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are. So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they\\'re good at killing. Euron Greyjoy didn\\'t come here for that. A queen. If not the most humble. What do you want in return? I decline your proposal. You\\'re not trustworthy. You\\'ve broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.  If the Mad King\\'s daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it.  Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.  But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown.  With their help the Mad King\\'s daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores.  Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts.  Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought.  This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty.  You all remember the Mad King.  You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people.  His daughter is no different.  In Essos her brutality is already legendary.  She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver\\'s Bay.  And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons.  It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords.  We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her.  No, I can\\'t say I have.  I haven\\'t seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room.  They were his trophies.  He couldn\\'t keep them around.  They would have made him look small.  Sometimes he would come down here and look at them.  I believe he brought his whores on occasion.  You\\'ve proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.  And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.  You shall have what your heart desires --  With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country.  I want you to know I understand.  Even though we\\'re enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you.  I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover\\'s head.  I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn\\'s skull breaking.  The sound of your scream.  I never heard a sound like that.  I thought, that\\'s true love.  Oberyn looked beautiful that day.  He really did.  No one moved like him.  No one had such skill with a spear.  Even Ser Gregor couldn\\'t stop him.  If only he hadn\\'t taunted him.  He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die.  But that wasn\\'t your lover\\'s way, was it?  Now he\\'s burried somewhere.  And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever.  That must be difficult for you.  When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can\\'t imagine how that feels unless you\\'ve lost a child.  I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse.  I couldn\\'t bear to see her in another woman\\'s arms.  I never got to have a mother.  But Myrcella did.  She was mine and you took her from me.  Why did you do that?  It doesn\\'t matter now.  Your daughter is a beauty too.  Brown eyes, those lips.  A perfect Dornish beauty.  I imagine she is your favorite.  I know, I know, we\\'re not supposed to have favorites.  But still, we\\'re only human.  We love who we love.  I\\'m sorry.  I can\\'t understand you.  The gag makes it difficult to understand what you\\'re saying.  It must be frustrating.  We all make our choices.  You chose to murder my daughter.  You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.  Do you feel powerful now?  I don\\'t sleep very well, not at all really.  I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies.  How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter.  I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn\\'s.  It would be poetic I suppose but fast.  Too fast.  I thought about having him crush your daughter\\'s skull.  She\\'s so beautiful.  The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it\\'s just not right.  Qyburn, he\\'s the cleverest man I know.  Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella.  The long goodbye, was that it?  That\\'s the one.  How long does the poison take?  But death is certain?  Your daughter will die here in this cell.  You will be here watching when she does.  You will be here the rest of your days.  If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat.  You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you\\'ve made.  Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours.  I don\\'t want her to miss a thing.  I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  I\\'ll do as I please.  Good.  And we\\'ll need fresh sheets for the bed.  The Iron Bank didn\\'t send you hear to offer condolences.  The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.  The Iron Bank wants its gold back.  And we both know gold wins wars.  Your vaults are empty.  Your late husband\\'s profligacy saw to that.  And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.  That\\'s a fancy way of saying bet.  The war has already begun.  I\\'ve drawn first blood.  I decapitated the Dornish snake.  My armada owns the Narrow Sea.  Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.  Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think.  Now, let\\'s talk about the Targaryen girl.  You want to invest in her?  I\\'m guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade.  How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?  From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch.  In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?  The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts.  Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?  Give me a fortnight.  Stay in King\\'s Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.  You\\'re too kind, My Lord.  Is on its way.  My brother is supervising its transportation himself.  We must devise a way to raise their spirits.  My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.  It will indeed.  I need to expand my armies, my navies.  My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos.  That\\'s good to hear.  I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.  How many men did we lose?  It\\'s armies that win wars.  We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us.  We can buy mercenaries.  They\\'re not the same as our men but they\\'ll fight if they\\'re well paid, which they will be.  So what do we do?  Sue for peace?  I sit on her father\\'s throne, the father you betrayed and murdered.  And in her mind she\\'s winning.  What sort of offer do you think she\\'d make?  Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.  You saw the crossbow, you saw his body.  After all this time it still amazes me --  And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?  And you believed her?  I shouldn\\'t have listened to you.  She should have died screaming.  So we fight and die or we submit and die.  I know my choice.  A soldier should know his.  That won\\'t be necessary.  He\\'s Hand of the Queen.  Why are you here?  What did our brother have to say?  To discuss a surrender?  She just won a great victory.  Why would she want a truce now?  Are you going to punish him?  Bronn.  He betrayed you.  He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent.  Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?  I\\'ve come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest.  She has the numbers.  If we want to beat her we have to be clever.  We have to fight her like father would have.  Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house.  For this.  You.  Do you remember what father used to say about people?  Never betray me again. Why isn\\'t she with them? And the rest of them? Including our brother.  If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king. Where is she? Didn\\'t travel with you? We\\'ve been here for some time. Sit down or leave. So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days? Then why are we here? I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement. I don\\'t think it\\'s serious at all. I think it\\'s another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you\\'re asking me for a truce. That\\'s all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men. The word of a would-be usurper. What are you talking about? He\\'s right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy. In return, the King CHUCKLES I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark\\'s son. I know Ned Stark\\'s son. Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you. I shouldn\\'t be surprised, I suppose. She\\'s your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn\\'t know her place. So you bring her here with her pet Northerner,  whom you\\'ve convinced to bow down before her. And now you\\'ve got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you\\'ve worked towards your entire life. the destruction of this family. You killed our father Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one would\\'ve touched them if Father-- I will not hear it, not from you. I will not hear it! I will not It doesn\\'t matter. Your love doesn\\'t matter. Your feelings don\\'t matter. I don\\'t care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future. Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction. What did you hope for?  To make Jon Snow submit to your queen. But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her. Why? You said she\\'d destroy King\\'s Landing. That\\'s the difference between you. I don\\'t care about checking my worst impulses. I don\\'t care about making the world a better place. Hang the world. That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn\\'t think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter. My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We\\'ll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you\\'ll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them. Ser Jaime. My lords, I need a moment with my brother. What are you doing? Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot? I\\'ll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father. I saw it burn. If dragons can\\'t stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can\\'t stop them, how will our armies make a difference? And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen-- Our child will rule Westeros. The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they\\'re all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us. And then we rule. The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North. How many dragons did you see at the pit? What happened to the third? She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable. No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You should\\'ve listened more when Father-- Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen? And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen. You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies\\' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy. And that will be treason. Disobeying your queen I told you no one walks away from me.  There\\'s one more yet to come. Good. Twenty-thousand men, is it? Horses? And elephants? That\\'s disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants. In any event, you are most welcome here in King\\'s Landing, Captain Strickland. You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest. After the war. That was our agreement. You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her. You\\'re insolent. I\\'ve executed men for less. I wanted those elephants. You\\'re insulting my late husband? Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn\\'t know his way around a woman\\'s body. You enjoy risking your neck, don\\'t you? You\\'re not boring, I\\'ll give you that. You might be the most arrogant man I\\'ve ever met. I like that. But now I want to be alone. Our message was well-received, then? You\\'re certain about the dragon? That must have been glorious. When the war is won, the Lion shall rule the land, the Kraken shall rule the sea and our child shall one day rule them all. Of course she is. Keep the gates open. If she wants to take the castle, she\\'ll have to murder thousands of innocent people first. So much for \"the Breaker of Chains.\" to MISSANEDEI If you have any last words, now is the time.', 'JAIME': ' There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We’re Lannisters. Lannisters don’t act like fools. But who would he tell? If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he’s off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on. That’s an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short. Don’t get up. You’ve much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention. A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don’t leave me alone with these people. I thought you might say that. But since we’re short on time, he opens the door; a bevy of whores enter and descend on TYRION Come on, girls. See you at sundown. I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it’s true. I’m sure we’ll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale. No? Getting a little old for it? Well said. Are you completely mad? It’s all right. It’s all right. I heard you the first time. To BRAN Quite the little climber, aren’t you? How old are you, boy? Ten. The things I do for love. King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I\\'ve never seen you with a girl. You don\\'t trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle? Smart boy. What\\'s wrong? Don\\'t like being called ‘boy’? Insulted? If that\\'s true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him. I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head. You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives? You think my father\\'s going to negotiate with you? You don\\'t know him very well. Three victories don\\'t make you a conqueror. You think my father’s going to negotiate with you? You don’t know him very well. Is she the fat one? No, no. There\\'s only one fat Lannister. If she was your mother, you\\'d know it. When? I went to Willem Frey\\'s wedding? He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name? Poor lad. That was my brother\\'s doing, I seem to recall. I remember you. You\\'d never squired for anyone before. You didn\\'t, though. You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It\\'s a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them. You were saying? More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit? I understand completely. It\\'s just that I I was 16 once. I also had to replace someone\\'s squire on short notice. Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time. He was A painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn\\'t imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don\\'t need to explain how that felt, not to you. It\\'s like stepping into a dream you\\'ve been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life. No. I didn\\'t have your gift. He couldn\\'t take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16-year-old squire. It\\'s a good thing I am who I am. I\\'d have been useless at anything else. I\\'m not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint. Of course. Every day. Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful. But there is a way, I think. It wasn\\'t possible until now. It\\'s actually quite simple. You\\'ll only have to do one thing. whispersYou\\'ll have to die. Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark. I would have come to your defense, but You\\'ve become a real she-wolf in your later years. There\\'s not much fish left in you. Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it\\'s my last night in this world. Is that a woman? Old Lord Karstark doesn\\'t seem to like me. Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same. So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It\\'s too much. No matter what you do, you\\'re forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast? Kingslayer. What a king he was. Here\\'s to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back. Do you know, I\\'ve never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered? No, that wasn\\'t it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore\\'s baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You\\'re not very good at pretending. You\\'re an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn\\'t you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman. Damn. You\\'re much uglier in daylight. What\\'s your name? I\\'m Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin. A captive knight has a right to know his captor\\'s identity. Tarth, Tarth, Tarth. Crescent moons and starbursts. Lord Selwyn Tarth. Your father. Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? It\\'s a long way to King\\'s Landing. Might as well get to know one another. Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah. I didn\\'t mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me. Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you? Has anyone ever told you you\\'re as boring as you are ugly? I already have. Look at you. You\\'re ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight? The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You\\'re not one of them. If you\\'re so confident, unlock my chains. Let\\'s see what happens. I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You\\'re afraid. You\\'re a virgin, I take it? Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne. Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I\\'m strong enough. Of course you are. You\\'d love to know what it feels like to be a woman. Ah. \"They lay with lions.\" Tavern girls, I\\'d say. Probably served my father\\'s soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That\\'s how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks. Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams. What are you doing? We shouldn\\'t stay here. We should get back on the river. Untie me. Now! Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew? But it\\'s not a crime to starve. That\\'s justice for you. For stealing a pig? Have you been to Ashemark? Then you don\\'t know me. Is it near Ashemark? I\\'ve never been there. I wish someone had told me. I wouldn\\'t have had to steal that pig. Those were Stark men. Do you know how long it\\'s going to take us to get to King\\'s Landing walking through fields and forests? So how shall we pass the time? It\\'s going to be a very dull walk. You know, it doesn\\'t matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week\\'s journey with you and she\\'ll order you to fall on your sword. All the good it\\'s done her. How did you come into Lady Stark\\'s service? There\\'s something we can talk about. It had to be recently. You weren\\'t with her at Winterfell. Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways. Were you pledged to Stannis? Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn\\'t fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal. Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don\\'t forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you. Sounds like you quite fancied him. Oh, gods, you did. Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren\\'t Renly\\'s type, I\\'m afraid. He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You\\'re far too much man for him. Unless they\\'re about me. It\\'s all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It\\'s a shame the throne isn\\'t made out of cocks. They\\'d have never got him off it. I don\\'t blame him. And I don\\'t blame you, either. We don\\'t get to choose who we love. No, you really can\\'t. He knows who I am. Maybe you\\'re right.  But what if you\\'re not? What if he tells someone? More innocent than Lady Stark\\'s daughters?  It\\'s a tough decision-take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water. Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river. It\\'s wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose? Gambler at heart. Wouldn\\'t have guessed. I need to rest. I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them? Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year. This heel is ruined. There\\'s no way-  I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords. Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman. You shouldn\\'t grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game. Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don\\'t kill me, I\\'m going to kill you. You\\'re good. Graceless, but good. See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there. We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste. Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.  I hope you\\'re pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us. I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren\\'t bound. I\\'ve been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year. You were not beating me. When we make camp tonight, you\\'ll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You\\'d be wise not to resist. They\\'ll knock your teeth out. No, I don\\'t think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I\\'m the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter? Close your eyes. Pretend they\\'re Renly.  If I was a woman, I\\'d make them kill me. But I\\'m not, thank the gods. You know who she is, don\\'t you? She\\'s Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth? They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones. Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter\\'s weight in sapphires if she\\'s returned to him. But only if she\\'s alive, her honor unbesmirched. Not defiled. I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse. Two hours every day holed up in the maester\\'s chambers. I learned a lot of fancy words. Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding. Now that we\\'re speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree. I\\'m not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it. I\\'m not as young and resilient as I was once. I\\'m famished, actually. Well, I do like partridge.  My father--  Don\\'t. desperately Water. Water. Please, water. Wa-water. Water, please. Please. Please. If I die, you won\\'t be getting-- I\\'m dying. I don\\'t care about revenge. My sword hand. I was that hand. Lord Bolton. Is there word from the capital?  Roose BOLTON: You haven\\'t heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King\\'s Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father\\'s forces prevailed. Will I die? Then you\\'ll die. You\\'re no maester. Where\\'s your chain? I don\\'t need my right hand to kill you. Mmm. No milk of the poppy. I\\'ll scream. I\\'ll scream loudly. Not so hard. You\\'ll scrub the skin off. I need a bath. Help me out of these rags. Now get out. This one suits me fine. Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don\\'t intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub. You swore a solemn vow, remember? You\\'re supposed to get me to King\\'s Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him. That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most-- I\\'m apologizing. I\\'m sick of fighting. Let\\'s call a truce. I trust you. There it is. There\\'s the look. I\\'ve seen it for 17 years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You\\'ve heard of wildfire? Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right? Jaime. My name is Jaime. You should. But instead, you\\'re sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be? We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution. It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it. He\\'ll make time for you. Shall we drink on it? You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people? Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident. I\\'m afraid I must insist. Tomorrow.  Lord Bolton\\'s traveling tomorrow as well. He\\'s going to the Twins for Edmure Tully\\'s wedding. You\\'re to remain here.  I owe you a debt. nods I will return the Stark girls to their mother. I swear it. nods My father will make him Grand Maester if he grows me a new hand.  Roose BOLTON: You will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust? nods  Tell Robb Stark I\\'m sorry I couldn\\'t make his uncle\\'s wedding. The Lannisters send their regards.  What\\'s the purpose of an arm with no hand? Yes, we\\'ve stymied the corruption. You\\'re a learned man. You did well sewing up this mess. You\\'re far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle. So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many? What is? You performed experiments on living men. With their permission? Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside.  I don\\'t know. shakes his head Countless has a nice ring to it. A fair offer. Why not? sighs They\\'d be fools to kill her. We have to return to Harrenhal.  I\\'ve left something behind. And what are those orders? You think you\\'ll get a reward. You think you\\'re getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he\\'s going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I\\'m going to tell him this man chopped it off. Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now. Whoa. Be quiet. A wooden sword? You gave her a wooden sword. I\\'ll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there. Get behind me. Pull her up. We\\'re taking her to King\\'s Landing. Unless you kill me. What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton?  Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?  Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires. Cersei. Magnificent. Looks fresh-forged. No one\\'s made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria. Where did you get this much Valyrian steel? You\\'ve wanted one of these in the family for a long time. Two? Well, thank you. It\\'s glorious. Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands. No. But as long as I\\'m better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn\\'t matter. Where\\'s that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life. How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike? Home?You are the Lord of Casterly Rock. You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow. No. No. There\\'s my answer. My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don\\'t want Casterly Rock. I don\\'t want a wife. I don\\'t want children. Supper would be nice. I suppose you want the sword back. Groans You like it so much, you\\'re welcome to chop off your own hand and take it. Days? Uh... a hook would be more practical. Odd little man. What symptoms? You let him touch you? I\\'m surprised. You never let Pycelle near you. I\\'m not sure I\\'ve ever smelled a dead cat. You drink more than you used to. Why? It must have been traumatic for you. A rather short siege. Father disowned me today. You\\'re forgetting Tyrion. Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.  I want... Not now? When? I\\'ve been back for weeks. Something\\'s changed. What do you want me to apologize for? You think I wanted to be taken prisoner? Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you.  I... What are you saying? Go away. All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace? Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen. And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. All very good. I don\\'t expect any trouble. Margaery Tyrell, I\\'ve heard. The war\\'s not won. Not while Stannis lives. My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy. So this is the famous \"Book of Brothers\"? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. Chuckles Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. Laughs Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man. So they say.  There\\'s still time. I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest. Yes, there she is. To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead. Well, Arya Stark hasn\\'t been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money\\'s on dead. There\\'s a certain safety in death, wouldn\\'t you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication. What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here? Are you sure we\\'re not related? Ever since I\\'ve returned, every Lannister I\\'ve seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you\\'re a Lannister, too. You\\'ve got the hair for it if not the looks. Gilded steel. I\\'m not hungry.  Oh! No, I\\'ll do it. Leave us. I can\\'t fight anymore. I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass? I\\'m not Father. I\\'m the Kingslayer. When people find out I can\\'t slay a pigeon... With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can\\'t fight, he\\'ll tell everyone. My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword. Is this place safe? Uh-huh. I haven\\'t used a sparring sword since I was nine. Ah! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guard\\'s down. Come on, then. Ser Loras, it\\'s quite all right. Your sister looks very beautiful. So, looking forward to your wedding? Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect. Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she\\'d murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she\\'d murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you\\'ll never marry her. Move away! Joffrey! Joffrey! How are you?You are. You will be. I\\'ll see to that. Please give the queen a moment alone with her son. I don\\'t know what I saw. Tyrion\\'s my brother. Our brother. There\\'ll be a trial. We\\'ll get to the truth of what happened. You\\'re a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman? No. GRUNTS  I don\\'t care. I don\\'t care. I don\\'t care. What the hell was that? You\\'re a rare talent. When you\\'re fighting cripples, anyway. You talk to my brother this way? Do you think he did it? We\\'re done for today. You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie. To tell you the truth, this isn\\'t so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months. Maybe a bit. I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t come sooner. How do you think? Her son died in her arms. Don\\'t. You know what\\'s coming? Now that you mention it, she did ask. Depends. Did you do it? Are you really asking if I\\'d kill my brother? How can I help you? You know I can\\'t. What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I\\'m the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Inappropriate? You\\'re accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason. Which is why we\\'re having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn\\'t matter to Cersei. She won\\'t rest until my head\\'s on a spike. Not just yours. She\\'s offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark. You sent for me, Your Grace? Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe... I promise you Tommen\\'s safe. We\\'re protecting him. What? You know why. She\\'d hoped I\\'d send her daughters back to her. I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I\\'d return them to her. I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off? Catelyn Stark\\'s dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it? I had to see him. I had to know for myself. He didn\\'t do it, Cersei. It\\'s the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there\\'s still room left on mine. Mmm. It\\'s yours. It was reforged from Ned Stark\\'s sword. You\\'ll use it to defend Ned Stark\\'s daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark\\'s dead. Arya\\'s probably dead, too, but there\\'s still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I\\'ve got something else for you. I hope I got your measurements right. I almost forgot. I have one more gift. Of course you do. My brother owes him a debt. He\\'s not safe here. You\\'re keeping him from harm. It\\'s chivalry. See? He\\'s a good lad.You\\'ll get along. They say the best swords have names. Any ideas? Good-bye, Brienne. Father\\'s orders. You\\'d condemn your own son to death? This isn\\'t a trial. It\\'s a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.  You\\'ve always hated Tyrion. As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?  Justice? He\\'ll be executed. Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I\\'m a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line. What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don\\'t even remember? It survives through me. I\\'ll leave the Kingsguard. I\\'ll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live. You have my word. You\\'re going to be found guilty. When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father\\'s agreed to it. He\\'ll spare your life and allow you to join the Night\\'s Watch. Father is not Joffrey. He\\'ll keep his word. Do you trust me? Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon. I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer. You threw your life away. You threw it away. It\\'s not a joke. You understand that, don\\'t you? You fell in love with a whore. Careful. I\\'m the last friend you\\'ve got. Yes, brilliant speech. They\\'ll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn\\'t realize you\\'d die for pride. I can\\'t save you this time either. My training has proved that I can\\'t beat a stable boy with my left hand. laughs It is tempting. If he wins. No. Not Ser Meryn. Soon. I\\'ve never seen him fight. Oberyn believes in himself. Beheading. Cousins. Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple. Nothing made you happier. You\\'d think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted. The joke wore thin, though. I had other interests. Why? Volarik. Tried to touch me once. Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles? He was twice your size. I don\\'t know. Good luck today. You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There\\'s really nothing you wouldn\\'t do, is there? Tyrion is your family. You don\\'t get to choose. Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn\\'t decide to kill her. He was an infant. The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you- Those are words. Told him what? You told him? You think he\\'ll just accept that? What did you say? Someone will walk in. Is that any way to speak about our mother? What do you think I’m doing? The galley’s waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities. Varys. You have more friends than you thought. There’s a locked door at the top of the stairs. Knock on it twice, and then twice again. Varys will open. Farewell, little brother. Quickly now. What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They’re going to try to take it away, all of it. All of them out there are enemies. They’re waiting a night to make sure he’s really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they’ll set to work on tearing us apart. This is exactly what they want. A summons from the queen. It’s a threat. No note. Softer. Not so loud. The world can\\'t know knows she’s our daughter. If I was the father to any of my children, they’d be stoned in the streets. I’ll make things better. I’m going to Dorne. I’ll bring our daughter home. I’m not going to ask him anything. No army. Do you know where they’re keeping her? I’ll find her. Is there anything else, your grace? I never said I was going alone. exit Jaime Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. Thank you. A pleasure. he kisses her hand Beautiful bride you\\'ve chosen. When were you planning on getting married? On with what? It\\'s very good for you. Mmm. I would have advised against that. \\'Cause you\\'re going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I\\'m going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle. As far south as south goes. Is that Estermont? This ship\\'s sailing to Oldtown. We\\'ll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear. Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night. No. You should be happy to go back. Drinks some water. We are not kidnapping their princess. We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family, That\\'s why you\\'re here. Because I don\\'t want to start a war. It has to be me. It has to be me. Quietly Varys set him free. He murdered my father. If I ever see him, I\\'ll split him in two. And then I\\'ll give him your regards. As far as I\\'ve seen, they\\'re all shit ways to die. I don\\'t care what\\'s sung about me when I\\'m dead. Sounds like all the rest. What about you? What shit way would you choose? How disappointing. I thought you\\'d have something more exciting planned. In the arms of the woman I love. Let\\'s go. Pentoshi. As I said. Why? A bag of gold. It was a heavy bag. Four. One, if he\\'s slow. I thought the sharks would get us. Bronn looks at him. I could have sworn those were shark fins. Luck. First we need to bury these bodies. Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We\\'re not here to start a war. Holding out his hand. I can\\'t dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really. Alright, thats enough. We’re trying to blend in. We don’t want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent. It can wait. Up there. That’s the Water Gardens. I like to improvise. Myrcella. Let’s speak in private. Excellent. Good to meet you. We have to go, Myrcella, now. You’ll be fine, I promise, but we have to-- And more hands. How’s Trystane? I’m sorry for that. It wasn’t supposed to happen that way. Your mother’s worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I’ve come to take you home. It\\'s for your own good. These are complicated matters. I don’t understand. Prince Doran. bows Princess Myrcella. What a lovely dress. You must be cold. Prince Trystane. How’s your jaw? Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella. We received a threatening message. The princess’s necklace in the jaws of a viper. Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading. I’m afraid he does. I accept. You have my word. May I inquire into the fate of my man? He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it’s me. You’re a good man. Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. I believe you’ve already met Prince Trystane. Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He’s agreed to grant you your freedom. There was one condition. Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me. She will. Of course, she’s my niece. Thank you. Try not to lose it this time. I know you didn’t want to leave Dorne. But I’m glad you’re coming home. Your mother’s desperate to see you. And I’m glad Trystane’s coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You’re lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so… so well arranged. If she sees you’re happy, I’m sure she will. I’m not so sure about that. Listen. There’s something I’ve wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you’ve seen more of the world, you’ve learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you’ve fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? Myrcella laughs My point is… we don’t choose whom we love. We just… It’s beyond our control. I sound like an idiot. What I’m trying to say. What I’m trying and failing to say… No. I’m afraid you don’t. Myrcella? Myrcella?! Myrcella?! Myrcella?! Mother. Shh, shh. Don’t think about it. She’s not suffering. She’s gone. No one can hurt her anymore. I know. You don’t believe that. Fuck prophecy. Fuck fate. Fuck everyone who isn’t us. We’re the only ones who matter, the only ones in this world. And everything they’ve taken from us, we’re going to take back and more. We’re going to take everything there is. Almost. Your mother wouldn’t do that. Are you angry with her? Then why didn’t you let her come? She has every right to be here. They’re not putting your mother in a cell ever again. Not while I’m here. Why haven’t you gone to see her? Everything she endured, she did it for you. Why not? We all fail sometimes. Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you. Go and see your mother, Tommen. You’re a bold man. You must long for the next life. You imprisoned and humiliated my sister. What about my sins? I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back. I killed my own cousin. When the gods judged my brother guilty, I helped him escape their justice. What atonement do I deserve? Oh, the gods won’t mind. They’ve spilled more blood than the rest of us combined. They should be closer if you mean for them to save you. I’ve fought against worse odds. What did you do to him exactly? I haven\\'t been able to get a clear answer. Does he understand what we’re saying? I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place. So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow’s head like a melon. Has the Faith leveled official charges yet? That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching. I’m Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council. The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne. We\\'ve got a lot to discuss. All of us together. Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king’s ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.  You’ll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?  The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery\\'s back at Tommen’s side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome? My lord. Sorry to interrupt. We’re here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and we’ll be on our way. I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name. You already insulted one great house. It won’t happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street. I’ve been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You don’t have to do this. You don’t have to do anything. Not when you’re sitting in that chair. Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods’ mercy? I’m being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can’t manage it on his own because he’s 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months. I’m not going to the Riverlands. I’m going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone’s ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I’ll take them to the sept and I’ll remove the High Sparrow’s head and every other sparrow head I can find. He has our son! He stole our son! He’s torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart? You’ll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you. Someone certainly does. You’re an anointed knight. There’s quite a difference. You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army. I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost. Lothar, is it? ‘Cause you didn’t set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged. Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed. Only a fool makes threats he’s not prepared to carry out. Now let’s say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I’d do? I’m here by the king’s command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you’d like to take his place. The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he’ll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is. As I said, the siege is under my command. If that’s not to your liking, go home. Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley. He’s an old man. Blackfish. I don’t have them. It won’t stop with Edmure. You’ll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die. We’ll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I’ll spare the lives of your men. On my honor. The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause? You clearly have no intention of saving your men’s lives. Why did you come to treat with me? Well, now you have. I never thought you’d find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead. In my experience, girls like her don’t live very long. Well, I’m proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds. Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey’s murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here? You’re welcome to have him. With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell? They’re a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum. Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree. Exactly. We shouldn’t argue about politics. I’m a Lannister. Don’t ask me to betray my own house. What do you propose? Why would he abandon his ancestral home? Have you ever met the Blackfish? He’s even more stubborn than you are. All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won’t listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else’s home. You have my word. You have until nightfall. It’s yours. It will always be yours. Yes, Lady Brienne? Of course it does. Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. Lord Edmure. I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you’ll be properly fed and clothes from now on. The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I’ve heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You’re a potent man. You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he’ll have a keep of his own. I’ll remind you that our houses are at war. I’m sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences. Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It’s not. I’ll leave the judgments to the gods. I was your sister’s prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly. Perhaps, but she didn’t. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn’t hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son. No, I don’t, but I’m telling you anyway because you’re my prisoner. You don’t have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister. I’ll talk about whomever I want. She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there’s a fierceness you don’t often see. They’d do anything to protect their babies. Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love. That’s exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn’t matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I’ll send for your baby boy. And I’ll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don’t matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn’t matter to me. The people in the castle don’t matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that’s what I’ll do. Good. Bring him to me. You’re welcome to her. Those two have their eyes on you. Not my type. Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay. There you go. I’m sure he would be. Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey? No, but back in your day. Yes, you’re a great conqueror. They don’t fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you? Come on. What is this? He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain. No, not angry. Should I be? Dragonstone. They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that\\'s where she was born. Winter is here. We can\\'t win a war if we can\\'t feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock. If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side. Three kingdoms, at best. I\\'m not sure you understand how much danger we\\'re in. A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We\\'re the last of us. We never talked about Tommen. Our baby boy killed himself. Cersei-- Even Lannisters can\\'t survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family. We couldn\\'t. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they\\'re all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can\\'t win this war alone. The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King\\'s Landing? Well, it looks like all of them. How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them. They\\'re not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They\\'re bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can\\'t build or grow themselves. Oh, what did he come here for, then? You\\'re not a rightful monarch, though, are you? The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren\\'t you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there. The people I was cutting down were your own kin. And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.  Lord Tarley.  Rickon, isn\\'t it?  That\\'s it.  Thank you for coming.  The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever.  They might not have come if you hadn\\'t.  Do you ride for Hornhill today?  And what side will you be fighting for?  You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle.  Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --  I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.  I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies.  All of her enemies.  You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley.  She was a great woman, once.  Now she\\'s broken.  She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores.  The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.  I know you don\\'t like my sister, but you have to make a choice.  Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?  When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south.  I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.  This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they\\'ll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike.  Advice?  No.  Don\\'t.  What are you doing?  No one can see us like this ?  It is.  I suppose as well as can be expected.  The truth is Casterly Rock isn\\'t worth much anymore.  Well, it is to me.  My fond childhood memories won\\'t keep Cersei on the throne.  For now.  They won\\'t be able to hold it.  Euron Greyjoy\\'s navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left.  Eventually they\\'ll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros.  As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood.  There are always lessons in failures.  My father always said I was a slow learner.  Widow\\'s Wail.  To you, sure.  To others as well.  But after we\\'ve won and there\\'s no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they\\'ll wring their hands over the way she built it?  Possibly.  Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?  Yes, it has.  I think we\\'re done here.  Cersei had several ideas.  Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.  Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King\\'s Landing.  I talked her out of those.  No.  I made sure of that.  Halt that wagon!  I\\'ll save my confessions for the High Septon.  No, there isn\\'t, is there?  That\\'s a lot of money I just gave you.  You don\\'t want Highgarden.  We\\'re at war.  Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in.  Besides, think of the upkeep.  The more you own, the more it weighs you down.  They\\'re not mine.  The gold belongs to the Iron Bank.  We pay our debts.  Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you\\'re from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid.  When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you.  Stranger things have happened.  The current harvest?  Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?  No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I\\'ve heard you guys have a real talent for that.  Good.  We are stretched a bit thin.  Let\\'s give them fair warning first.  These men fought well at Highgarden.  Rickon.  I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden.  Your first battle?  And?  They didn\\'t deserve to die.  But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl.  So here we are.  What?  Spears and shields!  Spears and shields!  Spears and shields!  I\\'m not abandoning my army.  We can hold them off.  Hold the line!  Archers!  Archers with me!  Knock!  Loose!  Qyburn\\'s scorpion is over there.  I can\\'t shoot with one hand.  Come on!  Take cover!  Come on, boy.  Come on!  You could have killed me.  Ending the war by killing her.  That was only one of them.  She has two more.  If she decides to use them, to really use them --  Don\\'t you mean we\\'re fucked?  I have to tell Cersei.  We haven\\'t done a full counting.  I just saw the Dothraki fight.  They\\'ll beat any mercenary army.  They\\'ll beat any army I\\'ve ever seen.  Killing our men wasn\\'t war for them, it was sport.  Her dragon burned a thousand wagons.  Qyburn\\'s scorpion fired bolts bigger than you.  They couldn\\'t stop it.  And she has three of them.  This isn\\'t a war we can win.  He didn\\'t.  I\\'m not talking about father.  Tyrion didn\\'t kill Joffrey.  He had nothing to do with it.  It was Olenna.  She confessed before she died.  After.  If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen?  Which one would Margerey been better able to control?  Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?  She was telling the truth.  She\\'s dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house.  And if we don\\'t find a way out of this war we\\'ll follow them.  We don\\'t have time for this.  We should be preparing the city for a siege.  The Dothraki are coming.  I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.  Why down here?  Today might be the day I kill you by accident.  Don\\'t talk about our father.  I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I\\'d cut you in half.  What do you want?  You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.  Why was QYBURN here?  I met with Tyrion.  Daenerys wants to meet.  To discuss an armistice.  Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms.  Tyrion claims he\\'ll have proof.  Tyrion?  You let it happen.  Why?  Who will you say is the father?  People won\\'t like that.  The lion doesn\\'t concern himself with the opinions of the sheep. The thrill will fade. Gold? Family. Maybe it really is all cocks in the end. Yes, he\\'s always been a champion of the downtrodden. Perhaps you ought to sit down. How many? It\\'s been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield. Yes, and I\\'m not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I\\'m loyal to the queen and you\\'re loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother. Fuck loyalty? And tell her what? At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually. I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another. Our men in King\\'s Landing will march north in three days\\' time. We don\\'t have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We\\'ll meet at Lord Harroway\\'s Town and march together to Winterfell. Your Grace. Preparing the expedition north. You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy. You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us. This isn\\'t about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead! I made a promise. Our child will never be born if the dead come south. And then what? When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don\\'t you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we\\'ve betrayed them, they march south and kill us all! I faced them in the field. We can\\'t beat them. We can\\'t beat their dragons. Two. For all we know, it\\'s guarding her fleet! We can\\'t beat the Dothraki. We don\\'t have the numbers. We don\\'t have the support of the other houses! The Golden Company is not here. They\\'re in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us? You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander. I didn\\'t conspire with him. I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge. Treason? Doesn\\'t matter what I\\'d call it. Are you going to order him to kill me? I\\'m the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father Give the order, then. I  don\\'t believe you. She did. She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north. She has Euron Greyjoy\\'s fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she\\'ll have more than enough to destroy the survivors. I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise. Do you want me to apologize? I won\\'t. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I\\'d do it all again. Because this goes beyond loyalty. This is about survival. Thank you, Your Grace. I\\'m sorry for what I did to you. I\\'m not that person anymore. You\\'re not? You\\'re not angry at me. Why didn\\'t you tell them? What about afterwards? Yes, here we are. How do they feel about their new queen? And she is? Different? You\\'re sure about her? She didn\\'t seem sure about you. Hmm. No, that part is real. She\\'s always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn\\'t be too hard on yourself. She\\'s fooled me more than anybody. What? Your cock. Lady Brienne. He\\'s come a long way. I\\'m sure you\\'ll teach him. I\\'ve been told you\\'re commanding the left flank. It is. Yes, I think you\\'re right. What? I truly don\\'t. You want me to insult you? Good. I came to Winterfell because-I\\'m not the fighter I used to be. But I\\'d be honored to serve under your command, if you\\'ll have me. So, what can we do? If that\\'s true, he\\'ll never expose himself. That would be something to see. Mm. It wasn\\'t so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister. Do you miss it? Well, my golden-lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you. Oh! My lady. You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us. I\\'m sure someone does. Fabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood. You don\\'t need a king. Any knight can make another knight. I\\'ll prove it. Kneel, Lady Brienne. Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel. In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave. In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just. In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent. Arise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms. We\\'d better get some rest. We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn\\'t the time to drink, when is? to BRIENNE Um You are an only child.  You didn\\'t. I surmised it. You have danced with Renly Baratheon.  Drink.  Drink. That\\'s a statement about the present. You didn\\'t drink. In the game. In the game. This is Dornish. Suit yourself. You keep it warm enough in here. That\\'s very diligent. Very responsible.  You know the first thing I learned in the North? I hate the fucking North. I don\\'t want things growing on me. How about Tormund Giantsbane? Has he grown on you? He was very sad when you left.  nods I do, don\\'t I? It\\'s bloody hot in here. I\\'m taking your shirt off. I\\'ve never slept with a knight before. Then you have to drink. Those are the rules. She\\'s sworn to protect the Stark girls, so... Say something snide. To climbing mountains. What? That\\'s not your concern. You\\'re a dog. What are you doing with that? Power resides where men believe--  And you trust Cersei-- Highgarden? Are you mad? He\\'s not going to kill us. He wouldn\\'t be talking to us if-- Highgarden will never belong to a cutthroat. What happened? Have you ever run away from a fight? You think I\\'m a good man? I pushed a boy out a tower window, crippled him for life for Cersei. I strangled my cousin with my own hands just to get back to Cersei. I would have murdered every man, woman and child in Riverrun for Cersei. She\\'s hateful. And so am I.', 'DAENERYS': ' No. I don’t know. Thank you, ser. Are you from my country? Thank you, Magister. She’s beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don’t know how to say ‘thank you’ in Dothraki. Do you know the Common Tongue? Is ‘no’ the only word that you know? He said they ate meat. My brother didn\\'t know anything about dragons. He didn\\'t know anything about anything. She was Drogo\\'s first gift to me. I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream? Does it ever end? And you\\'re sure there\\'s no other way? No one will take my dragons. Turns to Jorah As you are mine. Speaking Dothraki Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast. Speaking Dothraki Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side. Speaking Dothraki Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood. You never have. Does it ever end? Speaking Dothraki Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.. Take our remaining horses. Find out how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side. He is blood of my blood. Who did this? They will like it far less when I\\'m done with them. Speaking Dothraki Shh. They cannot kill his soul. Speaking Dothraki Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre. Speaking Dothraki And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight. Valerian This isn\\'t your horse. Valerian Qarth? Valerian Will they let us in? What do you know of this place? I thought we were welcome. Horde? My name is Daenerys You know me, my lord? And what should I call you?  The beauty of Quarth is legendary  Qarth. My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored  I am not a liar. Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates. What are you doing? You promised to receive me.  If you do not let us in, all of us will die. Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first. Dracarys. Dracarys. He\\'ll be able to feed himself from now on. Let him sleep, Doreah. amused He loves you. Thank you, my friend. The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo. Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they\\'re happy. It sounds wonderful. Please excuse me for a moment. What are they doing? Dothraki  We are his guests! You can\\'t pry it or chop it or melt it. Dothraki Not even when we leave. Dothraki Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more. My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built. That\\'s not the kind of queen I\\'m going to be. What is the House of the Undying? He\\'s not my manservant and he\\'s not in love with me. He\\'s my advisor and he\\'s my friend. And what about what a woman wants? To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne. Because I promised my khalasar I\\'d protect them and find them a safe home. I want them because they\\'re mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.  And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you? So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You\\'re a conqueror, too. You\\'re just less ambitious. What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why? And behind the door? And it can all be mine? All I have to do? That was a romantic proposal. The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country. The usurper is dead. The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other. The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we\\'ll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world. And if I\\'d listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we\\'d all be dead by now. Do not speak to me like I\\'m a child.  What do you want? Tell me.  Why? So what would you have me do, as my advisor? And how do I get the ship? I look forward to meeting him. He shouldn\\'t make me wait. I already have a husband. And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery. Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want. My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. I\\'m not asking you for the kingdoms. I\\'m asking you for ships. Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne. My father sat there, before he was murdered. I didn\\'t come here to argue grammar. Not yet. There are many there that support my claim. I left when I was a baby. The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return. Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we\\'ve met. For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons. Do you understand? I\\'m no ordinary woman. My dreams come true. I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it. The Spice King refuses me because I\\'m a bad investment. The Silk King won\\'t support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat? You are one of the Thirteen. Nothing? They\\'re more valuable than anything in the world. There is no we, so why would you help me get them back? But it did happen under your roof. I don\\'t care where you\\'ve been. You came back. Irri is dead. She\\'s dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn\\'t protect her. We can\\'t find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse. You went to find me a ship. \"These people\"? And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse. The people in Westeros don\\'t know I\\'m alive. And then what? They\\'ll pray for my return? They\\'ll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That\\'s what my brother believed and he was a fool. You are not your brother. There it is. \"Trust me. \" And it\\'s you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don\\'t need trust any longer. I don\\'t want it and I don\\'t have room for it. And you are too familiar. Find my dragons. Please, they\\'re my children. I\\'m begging you. Without me, the dragons will die.  How? You have my dragons?  But there is no King of Qarth. Astapor? They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children. You should sail to Astapor. I\\'m sure you\\'ll be safe there. Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there.  And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember? They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them. Let them try. Is this a riddle? Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks? You want me? Here I am. Are you afraid of a little girl? dothraki  This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me. Took you from me before I could even Maybe I am dead and I just don\\'t know it yet. Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands. That sounds like something you would do. Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. This is not my home. My home is across the sea, where my people are waiting for me. Dracarys. Come. Nothing. Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. Thank you for teaching me this lesson. Looks real enough to me. Real enough to buy a ship? Not fast enough. I can\\'t wait that long. I need an army The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people. It\\'s too beautiful a day to argue. Don\\'t mock them. They\\'re the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they\\'ll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar ... Tell the good master there is no need. You take a babe from its mother\\'s arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin? How many do you have to sell? 8,000 dead babies. Once I own them, these men ... Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be? to Jorah The warlocks. I owe you my life, ser. You know this man?  To whom? Give me your water. Here, drink. The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents. Do you disagree, Ser Barristan? Did you know him well, Ser Barristan? I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon. They did not. I want to buy them all. Yes. 8,000. And the ones still in training as well. I will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I\\'ll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.  I have dragons. I\\'ll give you one.  One. One.  Done. I\\'ll take you as well, now. You\\'ll be Master Kraznys\\' gift to me. A token of a bargain well struck. You\\'re both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you\\'ll be advising someone else. Is that understood? Do you have a name? Do you have a family? A mother and a father you\\'d return to if you had the choice? You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth. I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? \\'Let me die.\\' Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience? And what about you? You know that I\\'m taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed. Yes, all men must die. But we are not men. Is it done, then? They belong to me? speaks Valyrian Unsullied! speaks Valyrian Forward march! speaks Valyrian Halt! speaks Valyrian A dragon is not a slave. speaks Valyrian I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old  Valyria. Valyrian is my mother tongue. speaks Valyrian Unsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child. Strike the chains off every slave you see! Dracarys. speaks Valyrian Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men? These are the ones? speaks Valyrian You did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks? speaks Valyrian  Remove your helmet speaks Valyrian What is your name? speaks Valyrian Grey Worm. speaks Valeryan From this day forward you will choose your own names. You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same. Throw away your slave name. Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride. I don\\'t want half my army killed before I\\'ve crossed the Narrow Sea. How many slaves are there in Yunkai? Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city. speaks Valyrian Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor.  GREY WORM: nods You may approach. Sit. Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early. My ship? And what do you ask in return? I have a gift for you as well. Your life.  And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy. I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother. My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You\\'d be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out. And what happens to things that don\\'t bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about? Find out. You know these men? Is he more titan or bastard? How many? Enough to make a difference?  It\\'s hard to collect wages from a corpse. I\\'m sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side. I\\'d like to talk to the Titan\\'s Bastard about winning. He will. A man who fights for gold can\\'t afford to lose to a girl. We have no slaves here. Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons? We have more, don\\'t we? I\\'m only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us. You\\'re very young to be a captain. Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don\\'t favor your side. Or you could fight for me. I would pay you as much and more. Ride with me and you\\'ll never need another contract. You\\'ll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms. A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide. speaks Valyrian These men are our guests. Speaks common. You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you\\'d like a flagon to help you ponder.  A barrel, then. Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first. 19 How can anyone speak 19 languages? in Dothraki Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride. Athjahaka. Athjahakar. Well, I suppose I\\'m a bit out of practice. What do you want? Let her go. You were sent here to kill me?  So why haven\\'t you? What do your captains have to say about that? Why? Over what? You\\'re a strange man. And this is supposed to impress me? Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades? Will you fight for me?  Swear to me. Where? [Speaking to Grey Worm in Valyrian] Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa. [Speaking in the Common Tongue in this case, English again] You leave tonight. And Daario Naharis? Perhaps they didn\\'t want to be conquered. People learn to love their chains. No. speaking Valyrian  You do not owe me your freedom.  I cannot give it to you. Your freedom is not mine to give. It belongs to you and you alone. If you want it back, you must take it for yourselves. Each and every one of you. What does it mean? It\\'s all right. These people won\\'t hurt me. in Valyrian Fly.  in Valyrian Let me pass Ser Barristan. Where\\'s Daario Naharis? Where\\'s Grey Worm? Gambling? How long have they been at it? What\\'s the prize to winning this stupid contest? The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for. Have you ever been to Meereen? And? And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried? You were told to ride at the back of the train. All right, what is this matter of strategy? Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding? Would you like to walk without shoes? You are a gambler, aren\\'t you? How many miles are there between here and Meereen? You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her. Are they attacking? What is he doing? I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion? Which is why you must remain by my side. You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life. Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while. Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching. You sure you don\\'t want a horse? Horses are faster than men. valyrian I am Daenerys Stormborn. valyrian Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you. Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward! Fire! How are the lessons coming?  You\\'ll have to continue later. It\\'s time. Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts? Yes, that was it. I will answer injustice with justice. Who told you to take the Navy? So why did you do it? How many ships? How many men can they carry? Would that be enough to take King\\'s Landing? Please leave me. Not you, Jorah.  It appears my liberation of Slaver\\'s Bay isn\\'t going quite as planned. You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn\\'t listen. That all worked out well. How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can\\'t control Slaver\\'s Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me? I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros. I will do what queens do. I will rule. speaking Valyrian You stand before Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons. Don\\'t be afraid, my friend. I thank him for his prayers. Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship. I cannot bring back his goats,  but I will see he is paid their value three times over. Send the next one in. Speaking Valyrian The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself. I thank you. Then it is my honor to receive you. For that, he has my gratitude. I should be honored to meet him. Your father crucified innocent children. I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You\\'d be wise to remember that. And what traditions do you speak of? And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial? Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq. How many more?  212? Send the next one in. How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded, Don\\'t do that again. These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you. Tell me why you\\'re here. I\\'ve ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing. And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue. You swore me your sword. So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets? Very well. Do what you do best. Take off your clothes. You\\'re here early. You don\\'t approve? You neither approve nor trust. Didn\\'t you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother? I trust you. I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That\\'s why I\\'ve sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai. I have. That is why I\\'ve ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers\\' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself. And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning? Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it. And now you are helping me show them to freedom. The man who came to me the other day about burying his father. He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.  Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind. No. Tell him you changed my mind. You speak it very well. I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you? I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them. My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you. What is it that you want from me? You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair? I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year. Approach my friend. What was her name? How old was she? Three. *in Valyrian* And still no word on Drogon? *in Valyrian* Meet me in the catacombs. Sons of the Harpy? They’ve never killed before. I didn’t conquer them. Their own people did. Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost? I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces. Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me. Good. Concessions? I’m not a politician. I’m a queen. I don’t expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery. The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death? No fighting pits. I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting. How many times must I say no before you understand? Whatever he wants from me he’s not going to get it. If he really believes I’m going to reopen the fighting pits… What? Why? You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you’re defending the fighting pits? That’s why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets. I don’t want another child’s bones dropped at my feet. No one’s seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he’s flown halfway across the world. I can’t control them anymore. Viserion? Rhaegal? Easy. Easy. Easy. It would send a message. Why? Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was. Thank you all for your counsel. About what? The Mad King? You\\'re here to remind me of my enemies\\' lies? Consider me reminded. Go on. I\\'m not my father. I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial. Why? He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right. There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters. The Harpy\\'s life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law-- The law is the law. Take him. Leave me. Everyone looks happy enough from up here. Barristan chuckles. What? Why? He sang to them? And what did you do? He was good? He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. Sits down. And what did you do with the money? How many others are there? Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan? I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me. Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport? I do not recognize this tradition. \"Barristan the Bold\" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks. I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen\\'s great families and bring them to me. in Valyrian Walk forward. Valyrian Another step. Valyrian They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don’t. Children. Some say I should give up on them. One of the men is mumbling. But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must. Valyrian But she does not give up on them. Valyrian Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, Looks at Hizdahr, maybe none of you are. Maybe, Touching Hizdahr’s arm, I should let the dragons decide. Don\\'t want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps. If I give everyone what they deserve, I\\'ll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think? Sitting down. You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I\\'m here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think? What about \"Valar Morghulis\"? It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live. And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. Hizdahr nods. Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees. Don’t be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he’s smart enough to understand that. Are you jealous? I do. You told me yourself, I can’t fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice. So what else can I do? Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn’t. No. I can’t Of course I am a queen. Not a butcher. Sitting through the great games will be bad enough. I think I’ve seen enough. I’ve sacrificed more than enough for your traditions. Get him out of my sight. Who are you? You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are? If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn’t I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family? If you’d rather return to the fighting pits just say the word. And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you? I have a very large army and very large dragons. So you want to advise me. Very well. looks to Jorah What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned. Why should the people trust a queen who can’t keep her promises? Yes, many opportunities. No. Not until forced to do so. So I should kill him? Remove Ser Jorah from the city. So have you decided yet? Whether I’m worthy of your service? It’s probably my safest option. And what would your father do? Is that why you killed him? I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name. I’m terrible? Which kind is that? I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment. Perhaps it won’t come to that. Varys? King Robert’s spy master? Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me. But you trust him? The brother who killed my father. Perhaps I will have you killed after all. I’m not going to kill you. No. You’re going to advise me. takes his wine cup While you can still speak in complete sentences. How to get what I want. If I want jokes I’ll get myself a proper fool. I fought so that no child born into Slaver’s Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home. The common people. Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They’re all just spokes on a wheel. This one\\'s on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground. I’m not going to stop the wheel. I’m going to break the wheel. Where have you been? I’m not putting my money anywhere. Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you? That is greatness? One day your great city will return to the dirt as well. If need be. If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason. Someone else’s reason. Drogon! Valahd.. We have to go home. My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? pause We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen? How far did you carry me? surveys the area Drogon, we need to return. My people need me. Well, there’s no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar of the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons. I will not lie with you. And I will bear no children, for you, or anyone else. Not until the sun rises in the west, and sets in the east. I was wife of Khal Drogo, son of Khal Bharbo. I know. I burnt his body. If you will escort me back to Meereen, I will see that your khalasar is given a thousand horses, as a sign of my gratitude. What are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads! You have made a mistake. One you will regret. I am the wife of the Great Khal. Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons. My place is not here with you. Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen. That is more than most have. I need to make water. I will never run from Dothraki. I needed fresh air. The old women stink. You must have been very young when your Khal died. Too bad he didn’t die sooner. Mm-hmm. They do. Would you like to see them one day? No, don’t hurt her. We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive. No. We can do more than that. And you’re going to help me. Don’t you want to know what I think? No. I don’t want either of those things. I know where I am. I have been here before. This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World. This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains. And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you’ll raid, how many girls you’ll get to fuck, how many horses you’ll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will. You’re not going to serve. You’re going to die. Is there a cure? How long does it take? I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal. You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life. Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side. How many days’ ride to Meereen? How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros? And who has that many? Nobody yet. I take what is mine. What was I made for? Wait here. Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses? Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains? Are you with me? Now and always? The city is on the rise? Good. Shall we begin? I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan. You don’t approve? This is entirely different. We obviously didn’t communicate clearly. We’re here to discuss your surrender, not mine. My reign has just begun. Dracarys. You’ve brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands? And what’s wrong with you? Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before? Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king. We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well. Will their ships be enough? So why shouldn’t I wait for him? And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands? And you don’t want the Seven Kingdoms? And that’s all? Reasonable. She’s not demanding, she’s asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We’re not going to do that. We’re going to leave the world better than we found it. You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping. No more. You’re not coming with us. You’re not going to Westeros. You’re staying here with the Second Sons. There’s finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders. You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I’m going to rule in Westeros, I’ll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage. I don’t know. Maybe no one. I can’t bring a lover to Westeros. So that’s what you want? To be my mistress? I can’t. No one tells me to do anything. Don’t get angry. A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons. We can’t call it Slaver’s Bay anymore, can we? Farewell, Daario Naharis. No tears. It’s not. Yes, you really are. Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it. Well, you have completely failed to console me. It’s your counsel I need. Good. I, um… I had something made for you. I’m not sure if it’s right. Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen. Shall we begin? I wish I could remember it. I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn\\'t feel like home. Good. Not so many lions. They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health? People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them. If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he\\'d have invaded King\\'s Landing already. No. I never properly thanked you for that. You served my father, didn\\'t you, Lord Varys? And then you served the man who overthrew him? But you didn\\'t serve him long. You turned against him. So you took it upon yourself to find a better one. So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki. Who gave the order to kill me? Who hired the assassins? Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen? To keep yourself alive. Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that? Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I\\'m failing the people, you won\\'t conspire behind my back. You\\'ll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you\\'ll tell me how I\\'m failing them. And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I\\'ll burn you alive.  The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen.  You are very welcome here.  What is your name?  You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.  We\\'ve just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.  The Lord of Light doesn\\'t have  many followers in Westeros, does he?  What does your Lord expect from me?  The prince who was promised will bring the dawn.  I\\'m afraid I\\'m not a prince.  No, but I like it better.  And you believe this prophecy refers to me?  You know him?  He sounds like quite a man.  Very well.  Send a raven north.  Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.  That\\'s enough.  Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen.  You will treat him with respect.  I am not here to be queen of the ashes.  I\\'m grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council.  I\\'m grateful to all of you.  But you have chosen to follow me.  I will not attack King\\'s Landing.  We will not attack King\\'s Landing.  We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides.  Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.  Do I have your support?  Thank you all.  Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?  I realize you\\'re here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me.  But I swear to you she will pay for what she\\'s done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.  Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords.  I hope the seas weren\\'t too rough.  Forgive me --  Forever.  So I assume, My Lord, that you\\'re here to bend the knee.  Oh.  Well, that is unfortunate.  You\\'ve travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?  My father was an evil man.  On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family.  And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father.  Our two houses were allies for centuries.  Those were the best centuries the kingdom\\'s ever known.  Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.  I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.  Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.  Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.  Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it.  Then why are you here?  Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?  And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?  But still, I need your help?  Still, that doesn\\'t explain why I need your help.  You told me you liked this man.  In the time since he\\'s met me he\\'s refused to call me queen, he\\'s refused to bow and now he\\'s calling me a child.  As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north.  The dead?  Is that another figure of speech?  I was born at Dragonstone.  Not that I can remember it.  We fled before Robert\\'s assassins could find us.  Robert was your father\\'s best friend, no?  I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib.  Not that it matters now of course.  I spent my life in foreign lands.  So many men have tried to kill me.  I don\\'t remember all of their names.  I have been sold like a brood mare.  I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled.  Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile?  Faith.  Not in any gods.  Not in myths and legends.  In myself.  In Daenerys Targaryen.  The world hadn\\'t seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born.  The Dothraki hadn\\'t crossed the sea.  Any sea.  They did for me.  I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms.  And I will.  That\\'s fair.  It\\'s also fair to point out that I\\'m the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion.  You must forgive my manners.  You will both be tired after your long journey.  We\\'ll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.  Not yet.  And?  All of them?  Dragonglass?  Why are we talking about glass?  We just lost two of our allies.  And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?  And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?  Which wise man said this?  Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?  What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people?  Did you notice that?  I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They\\'re both gone now.  You lost two brothers as well?  People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are.  Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.  He is my Hand.  We all enjoy what we\\'re good at.  You know I\\'m not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.  And I haven\\'t changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.  I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it.  Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.  You better get to work, Jon Snow.  We need to find Euron Greyjoy\\'s fleet and sink it.  I\\'m not talking about sending our ships after him.  I wouldn\\'t be alone.  I\\'d have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal.  What can anyone do to them?  What about Casterly Rock?  Soon.  They will come back to me.  What happened?  Many things?  It\\'s all right.  When?  They were right here standing where we\\'re standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters.  Maybe even before there were men.  Doing what?  Fighting each other?  They fought together against their common enemy.  Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together.  We need to do the same if we\\'re going to survive.  And you say you can\\'t defeat them without my armies and my dragons?  I will fight for you.  I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.  They will if their king does.  They chose you to lead them.  They chose you to protect them.  Isn\\'t their survival more important than your pride?  What is it?  That\\'s very good to hear.  Isn\\'t it?  You will stay.  All my allies are gone.  They\\'ve been taken from me while I\\'ve been sitting here on this island.  Who won\\'t be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.  The right plan?  Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach.  Our enemies?  Your family, you mean.  Perhaps you don\\'t want to hurt them after all.  Enough with the clever plans.  I have three large dragons.  I\\'m going to fly them to the Red Keep.  My enemies are in the Red Keep.  What kind of a queen am I if I\\'m not willing to risk my life to fight them?  What do you think I should do?  I\\'m at war.  I\\'m losing.  What do you think I should do?  Dracarys!  Dracarys!  I know what Cersei has told you, that I\\'ve come to destroy your cities --  Step forward, My Lord.  You will not kneel?  You will not trade your honor for your life.  I respect that.  I meant what I said.  I\\'m not here to put men in chains.  If that becomes an option many will take it.  I gave them a choice.  They made it.  I\\'m not beheading anyone.  Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die.  Dracarys.  They\\'re beautiful, aren\\'t they?  They\\'re not beasts to me.  No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they\\'re my children.  No.  And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.  You\\'re not sure how you feel about that?  How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?  We both want to help people.  We can only help them from a position of strength.  Sometimes strength is terrible.  When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.  So it was a figure of speech?  He is my friend.  Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend.  You look strong.  You found a cure?  It would be my honor.  I\\'m happy for you.  You don\\'t look happy.  You said you don\\'t have enough men.  And give the country to Cersei?  As soon as I march away she marches in.  I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.  And how would you get into King\\'s Landing.  Well, it will all be for nothing if we don\\'t have one of these dead men.  I haven\\'t given you permission to leave.  We should be better at saying farewell by now.  But I\\'ve grown used to him.  Do you know what I like about you?  You\\'re not a hero.  I don\\'t want you to be a hero.  Heroes do stupid things and they die.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing.  Jon Snow\\'s not in love with me. My apologies. Yes. That\\'s all. Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word. I didn\\'t believe it until I saw them. I saw them all. A hundred thousand, at least. Just the King I\\'m grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it\\'s all for nothing, then he died for nothing. I didn\\'t come all this way to have my Hand Nods I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn\\'t done it, but I respect it. This place was the beginning of the end for my family. Speaks Valerian. A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren\\'t extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else. I can\\'t have children. The witch who murdered my husband. You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different. I can\\'t forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can\\'t pretend that Cersei won\\'t take back half the country the moment I march north. Laughs And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell. I\\'ve not come to conquer the North. I\\'m coming to save the North. We sail together. Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you. Whatever they want. Your sister doesn\\'t like me. She doesn\\'t need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can\\'t respect me- The dragons are barely eating. They don\\'t like the North. Go on. Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon. Then I\\'ve enjoyed your company, Jon Snow. Whatever you can. We could stay a thousand years- No one would find us. So keep your queen warm. Don\\'t be afraid. So you\\'re the man? The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could. I\\'ll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward. Well, there must be something I could give you. For what crime? From the Citadel? Not Randyll Tarly? I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused. Your brother stood with your father. Of course. Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor. He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp. Your sister pledged to send her army north. I don\\'t see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me. \"We\"? Like you knew your sister? Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat. So why have you abandoned your house and family now? What does the Warden of the North say about it? Very well. Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn\\'t know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool. Not for the first time. Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can\\'t help me take it back, I\\'ll find another Hand who can. Have you done something to offend me? Long ago and long forgiven. When I named him Hand, I didn\\'t know if I\\'d ever see you again. I wasn\\'t under the impression you liked him very much. He\\'s made mistakes. Serious mistakes. You\\'re advising me to forgive the man who stole your position? Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone. I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime. I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors. I didn\\'t ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good. I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei. I thought he knew his sister. Ours certainly have been. We have other things in common. We\\'ve both known what it means to lead people who aren\\'t inclined to accept a woman\\'s rule. And we\\'ve both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell. And yet, I can\\'t help but feel we\\'re at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother. That bothers you. All my life, I\\'ve known one goal: the Iron Throne. Taking it back from the people who destroyed my family, and almost destroyed yours. My war was against them. Until I met Jon. Now I\\'m here, half a world away, fighting Jon\\'s war alongside him. Tell me, who manipulated whom? I\\'m here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he\\'s true to his word. He\\'s only the second man in my life I can say that about. Someone taller. I take the Iron Throne. What is it? Your sister? But why aren\\'t you with her? Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You\\'ll be in the crypt. There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can\\'t fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You\\'re here because of your mind. If we survive, I\\'ll need it. Who\\'s that? My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her. That\\'s impossible. Who told you this? He saw it? A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn\\'t seem strange to you? If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You\\'d have a claim to the Iron Throne. Gendry.THAT\\'S right, isn\\'t it? You’re Robert Baratheon’s son. You are aware he took my family\\'s throne and tried to have me murdered? Yes, he\\'s dead. His brothers are too. So who\\'s Lord of Storm\\'s End now? Does anyone?I think you should be Lord of Storm\\'s End. No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm\\'s End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. Because that is what I have made you.  See? You\\'re not the only one who\\'s clever. To Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell! Are you drunk? He loved me. And I couldn\\'t love him back. Not the way he wanted. Not the way I love you. Is that all right? I wish you\\'d never told me. If I didn\\'t know, I\\'d be happy right now. I try to forget. Tonight I did for a while, and then I saw them gathered around you. I saw the way they looked at you. I know that look. So many people have looked at me that way, but never here. Never on this side of the sea. angrily It doesn\\'t matter what you want. You didn\\'t want to be King in the North. What happens when they demand you press your claim, and take what is mine? desperatelyYou can say nothing. To anyone, ever. Never tell them who you really are. Swear your brother and Samwell Tarly to secrecy, and tell no one else. Or it will take on a life of its own and you won\\'t be able to control it or what it does to people. No matter how many times you bend the knee, no matter what you swear. I want it to be the way it was between us. Sansa will want to see me gone and you on the Iron Throne. She\\'s not the girl you grew up with. Not after what she\\'s seen, not after what they\\'ve done to her. Even if the truth destroys us? It will. I\\'ve never begged for anything but I\\'m begging you. Don\\'t do this. Please. We can. I\\'ve just told you how. Cersei will make sure they don\\'t believe it. We will hit her hard. We will rip her out root and stem. No matter how many lords turn against her, as long as she sits on the Iron Throne, she can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. We need the capital. All right. How long do you suggest? I came north to fight alongside you at great cost to my armies and myself. Now that the time has come to reciprocate, you want to postpone.THE longer I leave my enemies alone, the stronger they become. We have won the Great War. Now we will win the Last War. In all Seven Kingdoms, men will live without fear and cruelty under their rightful queen. You saw my child fall from the sky. They took Missandei. Do you believe we\\'re here for a reason, Lord Varys? I\\'m here to free the world from tyrants. That is my destiny and I will serve it, no matter the cost. Speaking to Cersei will not prevent a slaughter. But perhaps it\\'s good the people see that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed, and Cersei Lannister refused. They should know whom to blame when the sky falls down upon them. in Dothraki Blood of my blood. You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits. Your tore down their stone houses. You gave me the Seven Kingdoms. Torgo Nudho. in Valyrian You have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen\\'s Master of War. in Valyrian Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother\\'s arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King\\'s Landing from the grip of a tyrant! in Valyrian But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world! in Valyrian From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel. in Valyrian Will you break the wheel with me? You freed your brother. You committed treason. In Valyrian Take him. When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with 1000 swords from Aegon\\'s fallen enemies. What do 1000 swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can\\'t count to 20? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon\\'s feet. It was necessary. I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me. He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who\\'ve done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?  I can\\'t. We can\\'t hide behind small mercies. The world we need won\\'t be built by men loyal to the world we have.  And it will be. It\\'s not easy to see something that\\'s never been before. A good world.  Because I know what is good. And so do you.  You do. You do. You\\'ve always known. They don\\'t get to choose. Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastard\\'s name and I was a little girl who couldn\\'t count to 20. We do it together. We break the wheel together.', 'WILL': ' Close as any man would. Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children. They were here. I know I broke my oath. And I know I’m a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I’m no coward. Tell them I’m sorry.'}\n"]}],"source":["# Open the file in read mode\n","plot_text = open(\"merged_file.txt\", \"r\")\n","\n","# Create an empty dictionary\n","d = dict()\n","\n","lines_dict =
